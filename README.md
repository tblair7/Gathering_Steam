#### Description
---  
Gathering Steam utilizes sentiment analysis on reviews as a function of time to predict changes in game reviews. Topics are extracted from segments of reviews where changes are predicted, providing a hypothetical game developer with points to address.  
  
An interactive demonstration of the results can be found on my [personal website](tylerblair.net)  
  
A four-minute video of me demonstrating the product can also be found [here](https://youtu.be/fnirYwyQ7Aw)
