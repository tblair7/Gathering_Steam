There I’ve already said it.\\n\\nStephen’s Sausage Roll is an excellent little puzzle game where you have to grill sausage rolls. It’s unique, inventive and clever and the only reason it’s here is I didn’t have enough to say for a full review. A puzzle game lives and dies on its puzzles and somehow this game has a ton of levels each with their own “a-ha” moment.\\n\\nThere are 86 levels here but very early and quickly the game becomes remarkably puzzling. Each level gives a great challenge and many levels have something new and interesting for players to figure out.\\n\\nIf you love puzzles game you’ll love this one, but I will say it’s one of the hardest but fair puzzle games I’ve ever played, so be prepared to be challenged. It is pricey at 30 bucks but exceptionally well done.\\n\\nI give it a\\n\\n4/5\\n\\nonly mostly due to being a puzzles game for established puzzle fans, and the price is really high.\\n\\nI want to thank Joseph Anderson for talking about this game, and I’ve linked his video about it in the description.\\n\\nIf you want to read more of these reviews, you can see the full review with pictures and video at\\nhttps://kinglink-reviews.com/2018/12/31/kinglink-reviews-end-of-year-celebration-2018/.

Every puzzle was flawless, I tried many times to cheese things or bypass the correct way of doing things, and it simply wasn't possible.\\n\\nThe complexity of the tasks was mind-boggling, but the rigid mechanics of the game mean there's only so many ways you can interact with the pieces, and so the solution is always an attainable prospect, if you just work through the possible moves until understanding smacks you in the face.\\n\\nAlmost every puzzle is very difficult to work out, and super satisfying to complete. But there's actually more joy to be had from each one in the final walk of the game, in arranging things nicely. I spent a weirdly large amount of time doing that, trying to break the rules and screw with the world.\\n\\nI can't exactly say I had FUN playing this. It's not that kind of enjoyment, or at least wasn't for me. It was a trial, a chore, but one that was very definitely worth working through.\\n\\nYou will be stumped. You will get frustrated. You will occasionally get angry. You'll hate yourself a little more as the game goes on. But you WILL cook those sausages. And you will LOVE IT.\",\n",

Fortunately, if you do something wrong, press a button and undo the last action so you don\\'t need to solve the entire puzzle again. A [i]Sokoban-style[/i] masterpiece.\\n\\nThough it may not be for everyone because of its difficulty, it\\'s everything hardcore puzzle lovers expect from a \"puzzle game\", a challenge. And Stephen\\'s Sausage Roll is a big and round one. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)',\n",

When you finish each \"world\" gratification comes in form of both the knowledge that you have conquered yet another devious set of puzzles AND a little tune that vaguely reminds me of that youtube video of some nerd playing the Titanic theme on a recorder. Will constantly surprise you not only with how many ways there are to manipulate a sausage (hur hur hur) but also with how many ways there are to fail a level. Quick, infinite undo button allows you to experiment wildly on each level, which quickly teaches you that rapid-fire trial and error will just make you get it completely wrong a lot faster and haha no you really have to use your brain, good luck, this game is 100% idiot-proof.',\n",

The game steadily introduces new mechanics after mastering previous ones. These mechanics give the game incredible longevity without dramaticly increasing the complexity of any individual puzzle.\\n\\nThe game includes an \"undo\" key to rewind so you don\\'t have to restart a whole puzzle if you make a small mistake. This encourages players to solve puzzles through experimentation so they don\\'t have to solve everything in their head.

       "  'review': 'Imagine you have a sponge, soaked up with several different liquids, some fluid, others viscous. This game squeezes that sponge so hard that it is completely dry by the end. While most games have tons of different mechanics that are only moderately build upon, Stephen\\'s Sausage Roll only has about [spoiler] 6\\t[/spoiler], however each one is built upon so much that there is pretty much no untapped potential. All you have to work with are 4 directional input keys, an undo button (absolutely genius, by the way), a restart button and a quit button. All of the mechanics are built upon these simple controls naturally. There are no prompts saying \"Press [button] to [action]\", The game respects your intelligence, and lets you learn these new mechanics on your own in over [spoiler] 80\\t[/spoiler] brilliantly designed levels. Each level has it\\'s own unique solution, no puzzles are the same. You\\'re uncovering a completely new mystery every single level. And the levels don\\'t artificially introduce new mechanics either, it\\'s all based in the simple rules of the complex game. I highly recommend this, it is an absolutely fantastic puzzle game.\\n\\nIf you like puzzle games, you need this, it is well worth the price tag. If you don\\'t, don\\'t.',\n",

You have to enjoy puzzle games and be ok with being stumped often to get into this game, but if that's you youre in for a treat. The way this game builds upon its seemingly simple mechanics to build ever more complex puzzles using the same set of tools as before is astounding, and I was never bored despite the almost minimalistic set of tools at your disposal. I'd go so far as to say there wasn't any filler, either, and many of the puzzles are straight up genius. Overall I enjoyed this game greatly and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in a difficult, non-hand-holdy puzzle game.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I first heard about Stephen\\'s Sausage Roll, as did many others, from Jonathan Blow, creator of Braid and The Witness.  I trusted his recommendation, but the game isn\\'t exactly a looker at first glance, and the price was steep, so I didn\\'t latch onto it immediately.\\n\\nJump forward some months and Blow is showing off a little bit of his next project following The Witness, a top-down 3D Sokoban game.  For those who don\\'t know, Sokoban-style games are those tile-based block pushing games, like Chip\\'s Challenge or maybe Lode Runner.  I distinctly remember that my first thought was \"Why the heck is Jonathan Blow making something as simplistic as a Sokoban game?\"\\n\\nI was absolutely enamored by The Witness, a game that I thought really, truly pushed at the boundaries of what game mechanics really are or can be.  People have complained that it\\'s a game where you \"just draw lines\", but as Blow has explained those line grids are just a common interface that allows you to know exactly how to *interact* with a puzzle, without knowing really what the puzzle\\'s mechanics are.  You always draw lines, but that allows the question to always be how you draw them, and that commonality is key to allowing the game to play around with the mechanics and take the concept as far as it could possibly go.  On a mechanical level, it\\'s truly breathtaking.\\n\\nBack to Stephen\\'s Sausage Roll though.  When I saw a game developer I deeply admired following up on such a mechanically deep game with just a block pusher I thought it was such a downgrade, a boring and safe choice that baffled me.\\n\\nThat was what I thought before I played Stephen\\'s Sausage Roll.\\n\\nI saw it on sale and I finally figured it was time to give it a shot, especially considering the great reviews it had gotten when it came out about a year prior.  Stephen\\'s Sausage Roll is at its heart a Sokoban game- you push sausages around on a tiled level, onto specific tiles (burners) until you\\'ve cooked them all, get back to your starting point, and you\\'ve beaten the level.\\n\\nWhere Stephen\\'s Sausage Roll excels is the mechanical depth it can derive from such a seemingly-simple Sokoban setup, and the mastery of its level design/puzzles.  Your only controls are the arrow keys, which you use to move Stephen forward or back, and turn side-to-side.  Your fork, which Stephen holds in front of him, makes maneuvering intentionally awkward. \\n Maybe you just want to turn to the side, but your fork will swing in front of you and knock a sausage off the level; or perhaps you just need to walk through a narrow passage, but a pillar next to the path stops you from being able to turn because your fork will bump into it.\\n\\nThe awkward maneuverability allows for some incredibly compact and tight levels- but that\\'s just the absolute tip of the iceberg.  The game teaches you this initial awkwardness in maybe the first 3 levels.  From there, each world introduces a new mechanic that has *always* been there- you just probably never noticed it before.  It\\'s something intuitive, something that entirely makes sense, but you\\'ve been too busy wrestling with the other mechanics to think of it.\\n\\nYou might think all this sounds frustrating, but when you actually play the levels, and figure out exactly how you need to manipulate Stephen in order to get through them, you\\'ll feel like the smartest person on Earth.  All of these mechanics are taught to you through incredible level design, rather than some hand-holding popup explaining what you need to do.  You\\'ll think they must be impossible, but they really just require a new way of thinking that the game is expertly nudging you towards realizing for yourself.\\n\\nThe cherries on top are an excellent rewind feature that saves you from the frustration of messing up a move, like countless inferior Sokoban games will gladly ask you to restart the level after doing, and a great world map that allows you to move on to another puzzle for awhile if you\\'re frustrated.  There\\'s even a bit of a narrative with some emotional heft to it that culminates in yet another interesting gameplay idea.\\n\\nNeedless to say I can\\'t say enough positive things about Stephen\\'s Sausage Roll.  This game should be taught in game design courses for the next several decades; mechanically-speaking I don\\'t think it will be topped any sooner than that.  Apologies to Jonathan Blow, but I think it easily beats The Witness on mechanical depth because of the nuance and naturality of the mechanics, and how so much can be squeezed out of so little.  On the flip side however, I\\'ll be anticipated his own upcoming Sokoban game, now that I\\'ve seen what they are truly capable of.',\n",

No level uses way too many elements and becomes overwhelming, instead the game focuses on having a few amount of elements in a given level but still manage to create incredibly complex and clever solutions. Having created my own 2D platforming game where I included puzzles at times, puzzle design is a complete nightmare and it\\'s extremely impressive how this developer manages to create this many puzzles, each one having a unique solution without overwhelming the player with the amount of elements, while also sticking to such a basic ruleset, wow.\\n\\nI had to dismiss the thought of \"this level is actually impossible\" several times during my playthrough. I genuinely thought the game was impossible at times and had to actively dismiss that thought, this is something that very few puzzle games manage to do and another reason why this game is so fantastic.\\n\\nI picked up the game during a sale because I was skeptical and the pricetag sounded ridiculous.

       "  'review': 'Sometimes the diamond-in-the-rough narrative gets overplayed on Steam, yet given how exceptional of a game is here hiding behind a deceptively simple store page this game warrants its fame. Whether or not the developer intended this outcome, it’s somewhat appropriate for a puzzle game for diehards to use its vagueness of a description and its price barrier as deterrents to outsiders. As the old saying goes, “Laws are like sausages. It’s better not to see them being made. To retain respect for sausages and laws, one must not watch them in the making.” To people who do desire to see through the muck to see how principles come through solving problems, Stephen’s Sausage Roll may be up there with the Witness as one of the best puzzle games available.\\n   \\n[h1]Those Who Think They Know How the Sausage Rolls Do Not Yet Know As They Should[/h1]\\n\\nObfuscation is the metaphorical bread-and-butter of Stephen Sausage Roll, so explaining anything in detail will somewhat influence your experience; however, it is possible to know what type of experience you’re stepping into by discussing the game as a whole. SSR uses the entire game for its mechanics, leaving nothing nor asset unused from its world, Stephen and its many sausages. The whole package continues being iterative, adding new dimensions to previously learned skills that aren’t technically new abilities as you don’t earn them arbitrarily but rather through realizing you had these tools all along until you discovered them from experimentation. Similar to the Witness, you create new observations as you play that become tested principles, which continue to establish new hypotheses as applying these principles to a new context is half the challenge. \\n\\nAt the game’s core mechanic, the goal is to cook both sides of every sausage without burning them. Stephen comes equipped with a fork, which provides the first major hindrance, the control scheme. These controls are not bad nor broken; they are deliberately unintuitive to force you to think ahead of your next move. The best description is to imagine tank-controls where you can move forward and back given the direction of your fork, and the orientation of your movement changes when the fork is rotated clockwise or counter-clockwise. Many puzzles forces dealing with the awkward controls as navigation on the overworld takes time to adjust to them. After becoming accustomed to moving backwards more than moving forward, the game changes the focus onto the sausages and Stephen’s fork as every new island builds on those controls. \\n\\nRepetition breeds familiarity, and there are always new techniques between each puzzle to further expand the existing knowledge you may or may not have about the puzzles.  As you play, the problems with the controls become less apparent as rolling sausages and manipulating them to new heights become more urgent matters to learn. There is only one mechanic with the fork that becomes forgotten, and it feels more like an oversight not to make the game too difficult towards the finale. As a result, everything you master truly feels like an achievement as most challenges will leave you perplexed until that moment where everything clicks together brings a sense of clarity. \\n\\n[h1]When the World Comes to an End, What Idea Will You Leave Behind?[/h1]\\n\\nSimilar to The Witness, the open-ended world design and the narrative are blended seamlessly with the types of puzzles in the area in the large scale. The major differences between Stephen Sausage Roll and The Witness are that the narrative, however of a morsel it may be, is more satisfying despite being extremely simple and the worlds’ puzzles are more disjointed from the narrative texts. These aspects highlight a problem, especially with the spikes in difficulty, of not properly scaffolding information necessary for the player to get the idea. \\n\\nScaffolding is a common educational technique to pre-engage audiences in advance by transitioning from something more familiar to something entirely different with ease. In layman’s terms, it’s the process by introducing something old to teach you something new. SSR takes a similar idea from TW by breaking up the overworld into six regions, each emphasizing a new skill; however, unlike TW, the puzzle between each island meant to clue players into the next area’s challenge doesn’t always convey the correct expectations. For example, the bridge from the first two worlds does not prepare you for the first major challenge, The Tower, which suddenly reconfigures the puzzles in terms of height. TW always managed to achieve this goal with physical gateways to guide players to the next proper area. Only with the final island does SSR set the correct expectation that becomes the basis of the final twenty or so puzzles, which is what makes all the difference between needing hints or figuring things on your own.\\n\\nWhat the game does let you discover all on your own, perhaps with more interpretations than definitive answers, is the narrative behind the world. Interspersed throughout the lands are bits of lore to tell you of the society that came before you, presumably Stephen. The reasons for the disappearance of this former world are given some answers, namely the massive flooding around the world which surrounds you, yet it never tells you how that disaster came to be. Natural disaster by the whims of fate? Climate change by man’s influence? All you are given are glimpses of what wonders are left and what knowledge is left preserved on these floating islands out at sea, only those relics and a vague notion of some Idea worth saving are the last vestiges of this world. [spoiler](As a hunch, I think the Idea is meant to be the practice by which this society operates to thrive in these harsh times, and the mania it creates among its people are the result of the world’s consumption.)[/spoiler] The answers to these questions are treated with subtlety and meant to be open-ended for the player, which is the difference between players making their own answers and dismissing any value in meaning.\\n\\n[h1]Fortune Cookie from Lo Wang says, “What You Saw, Sages, is the Wurst of Man”[/h1]\\n\\nAs interesting as the narrative was to piece together, there is no definitive higher meaning to attribute the lessons from the game as some clever allegory. Perhaps it’s the result from one too many Wang jokes, but call it intuition that a game about rolling sausages is not searching for something revolutionary about the world. The real core value and the real pleasure about Stephen Sausage Roll comes from the process of learning from the puzzles themselves. Savoring them as a delicacy, even when they are too tough or too soft, is to appreciate how appetizing they are whether at the start or the end of the day to keep your mind proactive, and you certainly don’t want to be the only one missing out from experiencing the game for yourself. Buy several copies and share them with your friends; after all, the last person left will be all alone to fend for themselves, and wouldn’t that be such a waste?',\n",

I've been seeing it pop up for ages but I've been put off by the price and the screenshots but keep seeing positive reviews and have always been confused by to inconsistency so I picked it up in the sale. Since then I've gone through a few phases. When bringing up the menus I was worrying that this was some cheap thrown together thing. When starting the game I was worrying that this was some quickly thrown together scam that uses obscurity to mask that there isn't actually any game in there. After a few minutes I was mostly frustrated that I had no idea what was going on and hadn't been told anything. But at some point things start to click. It takes a little while to realise how the main character moves. It takes a little while to even realise how to get into the levels! But if you are a fan of puzzle games then persistence will reveal some really clever (devious) puzzles. This game pretty quickly got me into the frame of mind of being in competition with the developer, and as such, the presentation and the initial obscurity (and ongoing obfuscation of mechanics) almost feels like an extension of that. All of it feels like the developer is challenging you. After playing a few levels, even the graphic style, which initially put me off, actually feels kind of perfect. It's just another layer of the developer messing with you. I'm still not far into it, but first impressions and that this is going to be a really divisive game: Serious (and patient) puzzle fans are going to get a lot of hard-earned satisfaction out of this game. Anyone else has a serious risk of bouncing off it, or even not really discovering the game at all.\",\n",

Even with that in mind, I think I can say with confidence that this is one of the greatest puzzle games ever made.\\nThe puzzles are challenging -- this game does not underestimate the intelligence of the player.

Because of this, you never feel as though you\\'ve been cheated out of a victory.\\nThe game acknowledges that as a player, you may need to take a break. The non-linear nature of the puzzles encourages this attitude of \"coming back to it later,\" and I\\'ve lost track of the times I\\'ve gotten frustrated with a puzzle and shut the game off, only to come running back to my computer after a \"eureka moment.\"\\nHaving not finished the game, I\\'m not sure if it actually has a story or not.

(I prefer games that adhere to the idea of \"no bad clicks\".) \\n\\nOn the plus side it is actually deep. If you engage with the idea that every atempt to try somthing is punished then you can get into it. The puzzles are actually complex and leading somewhere intresting which is why you initally have an awful time trying to play with the deply unintuitive controlls.

       "  'review': \"Plenty of other reviews cover the gameplay, but I'm going to dig into the aesthetic because there's a lot to be found here. After playing Steven's other games it seems that he's a big fan of trying different things and seeing what works. Each of his projects feels unique in the sound and art design that adds to the feel of the game in a way I've seen no other developer do.\\n\\nYou might see Minecraft at a first glance with the pixels and blocky shapes in a grid. But as you observe the details you notice that the design decisions don't conform to one mold. The character is low-poly and abstract, with detail given in the shading of the triangles. The sausages are a perfectly round shape with no shading, instead given detail purely by the marbled or browned texture of the meat. There is an extensive use of particles and they're all different, from the foamy waters on the shore to the smoke rising as you accidently step on the grill. The animations of the character and moving objects are quick and snappy yet dynamic and full of character, and then there's environmental animations so smooth and hypnotic yet with long cycles so being stuck on a puzzle doesn't feel so encapsulating.\\n\\nThe sound design uses a fast and free approach of sampling a free sound website, but isn't content with that. It crops the samples down so small they're a tenth of a second or so, just the bit of sound that matters and captures the essense of the noise.\\n\\nThe music is similarly different. In the past, procedurally-generated music has been lacklustre, and mosly a fun experiment, but this game legitimately uses it for good. You won't find many catchy tunes other than the main menu music, which seems to be the only one not generated. Whenever you press spacebar it re-seeds the algorithm and comes up with a new tune, and otherwise will continue playing something very slowly in the background. A lot of it sounds discordant and halting. This works well for the tone of this game, giving you pause for thought and letting your mind wander. The start of each level, as well as some menu screens, use a predefined seed to start with a familiar tune each time you enter them before stuttering off into something new.\\n\\nOver the course of playing the game you'll discover more and more small details, but while it's consistent the whole way through it doesn't get old. Also check out Stephen Lavelle's other games, including Universal History of Light, which has the most bizarre yet fitting design choices and turns what I've talked about here up to eleven.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Stephen’s Sausage Roll isn't for most people. But you're not most people, are you? You hear about a puzzle game that's difficult, strange and expensive, and that doesn't put you off. It intrigues you. Because you crave a sensation only the finest puzzle games can provide: epiphany, Stephen’s Sausage Roll will give you your fix, and it will do better than that. Because Stephen’s Sausage Roll is transcendent.\\n\\nIt might not appear that way at first. You really have to earn its best moments. The first few hours provide a clever and challenging block-pushing game. And that’s fine. But there are plenty of clever and challenging block-pushing games.\\n\\nThose first few hours merely hint at what is to come. Push the sausages onto the grills. Get to the exit. The rules and objectives that govern the game are the same from the beginning to the end and it should start to feel repetitive, but it never does. Each puzzle require a new revelation. The mechanics seem so simple, so limited at first, but your understanding of them will be regularly disrupted and rearranged. You’ll be forced to maneuver levels in ways you didn’t realize were possible. Every sausage is a carefully-engineered precision strike to your brain. \\n\\nWhile playing SSR, I’ve pumped my fist in triumph many times. I’ve gone to bed thinking about sausages, only to rush back to my computer in the dead of night with a sudden realization. I’ve laughed out loud at one late-game mechanic reveal that’s more surprising than any scripted narrative twist could be.\\n\\n This is pure, uncut puzzlesolving. The story is slim, and there’s no rich world to explore. It ain’t Portal or  The Witness. But in terms of puzzle design, it blows them both out of the water, along with any other game I can think of.\\n\",\n",

       "  'review': 'While I would definitely call this a pretty dang good puzzle game, I wouldn\\'t say it\\'s one of my favorites of all time. The mechanics the game introduces naturally from the basic concept are cool and used in creative ways - the moment where you discover the last main mechanic about 2/3rds through the game is mindblowing if you don\\'t see it coming, honestly - but at the same time I feel like the game often overstays its welcome. In a few points, especially with worlds 3 and 6, I feel like a handful of puzzles were kind of fillery, only really introducing new ideas if you really stretched the definition of \"new idea\". And the main mechanic of world 5 is just abruptly dropped and never once returned to after you finish that world, which seemed a bit odd to me. There\\'s also one puzzle in particular in world 4 that is a bit irksome due to it outright not using the main mechanic introduced in that world, and a puzzle in world 2 (you know the one) that introduces a mechanic in a really unintuitive way & feels like it\\'s in the wrong world.\\n\\nBut for the number of times the game really impressed me and how fiendishly clever it is on the whole, I can\\'t help but recommend it. It took me a bit over 24 hours according to steam, with a months-long break near about the middle of the game due to the aforementioned irksome puzzle in world 4. But my gripes with this game are really minimal overall, I still would absolutely say this is worth your time, and honestly, it\\'s not as absurdly hard as a lot of people like to make it out to be, though it\\'s certainly quite challenging and, in terms of content, rather meaty as well. Eheh. But yeah... at full price, maybe, maybe not, but on sale absolutely if you like a good puzzle game.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Congratulations! If you are reading this, it means that you have stumbled upon Stephen\\'s Sausage Roll, the greatest puzzle game ever created. I don\\'t utter such praise lightly; I truly feel that this sausage-roller with blocky graphics is the crown jewel of the puzzle game canon, overshadowing such masterpieces as Portal, Antichamber, Braid, Fez, and the Zachtronics games that I previously held to be the gold standard of puzzle games.\\n\\nStephen\\'s Sausage Roll is, indeed, a game about grilling sausages. Most of the levels have from one to four of them and your job is to get them all nicely browned on all sides and return to the starting point of the level. The mechanics are simple and are the same from the beginning to the end. As you progress through the levels, the game pushes you further and further to find out all of the different ways those pesky tubes of meat can be moved around.\\n\\nWhat sets Stephen\\'s Sausage Roll apart from other puzzle games with simple mechanics is that there is very little repetition. Every time you feel that you\\'ve got on top of this sausage rolling business, the game throws something new at you. Almost every level offers a new \"aha moment\", and many of the later levels require multiple breakthroughs until you succeed. This makes the game feel fresh until the very end, a rare achievement for a puzzle game that takes well over 20 hours to complete.\\n\\nAn important thing to note before getting this game is that despite the colorful appearance this is no casual puzzler. This is a game that will push you to the limit. You will get stuck on some levels, maybe for a day, or maybe for a week. The sausages will roll into your dreams and you will find yourself incessantly playing through different approaches in your head throughout the day. Of course for a puzzle lover this all just makes it more satisfying when you finally succeed.\\n\\nAll in all, if you like puzzles and can handle a challenge, you owe it to yourself to give Stephen\\'s Sausage Roll a try.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I was not a fan of Sokoban-style puzzles because I always felt they involved too many trial-and-error attempts. But this game has changed my mind. I would recommend it to:\\n\\n1. People that don't mind (or even enjoy) lack of tutorials or gradual learning curves. Don't be discouraged if you have to spend 20-30 minutes in the first level (which I did), because this is where you learn all the basic skills and knowledge of the game. Even though I am familiar with puzzle games (e.g. Antichamber, The Witness) that expect players to figure out the mechanics themselves, this game still caught me off guard. However, the later levels, even though still difficult, are much less unsettling because now I had an idea of what the game wants me to do.\\n\\n2. People that love learning the game mechanics and use them to solve problems. Almost every level in this game will force you to use a new skill for the final solution, and it's nearly impossible to solve the puzzles by random guesses. The initial levels are already quite surprisingly well designed, but it's the later levels which fully utilize the 3D features that are really amazing. I was also surprised that for many levels, the developer managed to put two or even more different types of obstacles that you need to overcome.\\n\\n3. People that want to improve sleep quality. Maybe it's just me… I slept very well after playing this game 30-60 minutes every night (whether I solved the puzzle or not).\\n\\nAbout Difficulty:\\nYes, this game is not easy. But it's also very straightforward: you know what the final goal is, at least after the first level; there is no trick question or hidden information; you don't need to guess what kind of hint the developer expect you to take from the environment. Very often, I found that once I excluded every option that would lead to a dead end, the right solution naturally became obvious. Also, sometimes I felt I had been overthinking about a puzzle and wasting too much time trying different things in a level, but only later to discover that I had accidentally learned about a new mechanic that would save me a lot of time in another level.\\n\\nSome minor suggestions: \\nThese don't really interfere with the gameplay, but fixing them may help further improve the gaming experience.\\n\\n1. Sometimes it's hard to see the details of a level, like how tall is the Dragon Head, or how far is this island from that island. Perhaps allowing the camera to slightly tilt for a small angle can help.\\n\\n2. This game only saves when a level is solved, not when a level is started the first time. I could understand this is because of the features of later puzzles, but it's not quite convenient and not really necessary in the early areas.\\n\\n3. I like the different Game Over screens, but I also noticed some inconsistency in terms of which one would show up.\\n\\nIn summary, I enjoyed every level in Stephen's Sausage Roll, and I believe this is one of the most solid puzzle games ever created.\\n\",\n",

And I’ve played and finished Steven’s Sausage Roll, now what else has life got to offer? I highly doubt it…[/i]\\n\\n-----------\\n\\nAs a player, Steven’s Sausage Roll gives me existential crisis (literally not metaphorically), I kept dwelling on the thought of whether would it be possible for me to encounter another puzzle game that’s half as good as this Sausage Roll in the rest of my life, at least in the foreseeable future, the possibility is rather remote. For a puzzle enthusiast, this is really dreadful. \\n\\nSo here comes the only suggestion this pointless review is gonna offer, to prevent you from making the same mistake as I did: [b]If you do enjoy puzzle games and wish to extend your happy hour with this genre in general, you may want to consider postponing your first contact with Steven’s Sausage Roll indefinitely. [/b] Otherwise, many other puzzle games you used to enjoy would either feel like chewing cardboard or simply child’s play. Embrace Steven’s Sausage Roll only when you’re ready, ready to venture into the end of the world, the end of space and time, that kind of ready.\\n\\nI’m not saying that Steven’s Sausage Roll is the hardest puzzle game I have played, considering how players these days mistakenly value difficulty over quality, especially within the puzzle genre. No, I have played harder ones, but never have played any puzzle this ingeniously and sophisticatedly made. \\n\\nThus, as a creator myself, I am completely overwhelmed by the shadow it cast. Its total supremacy was like an unspeakable existence that you can never imagine yourself to surpass or even come close with, even if exhausting a lifetime of effort. Yet, it still exists there, silently and solemnly, like the Mount Everest, to frustrate you, to defeat you, to deprive you of all hope! And yet in the end, to motivate you…\\n\\nAnyhow, its otherworldly excellence has far exceeded my verbal skill, I’ll have to conclude this pointless review with this crude statement: \\n\\n[h1]Does the world need another puzzle game (especially Sokoban-originated ones)?\\nNot after this.[/h1]\",\n",

       "  'review': \"so as of right now i have 8.2 hours on record. I've only taken the opportunity to sit and play this once. so the first time i played this game, i pretty much played it all day. it never felt repetitive, even when it was just push and roll (spoilers, other 'elements' are introduced later). \\n\\nSolving each puzzle was satisfying. Even the complex levels were great, only got frustrated once by this certain overwhelming level (there were 8 sausages, the level was called the tower or something). \\n\\nAnyways! Last positive note i have is the overworld- basically you have sets of levels, complete them all in any order and then the next set is unlocked. I appreciate this set up because you're never forced to do any particular level at a certain time in order to progress. If a level annoys you, just leave and come back later. \\n\\nOk so a neutral point would be the graphics. Personally I like them, and I think it lends to some visual clarity to an extent. I made this point neutral because i can totally see how the graphics might be offputting to others.\\n\\nI have one negative point, although it is 100% pure nitpicking. sometimes its hard to see what's going on. I know this sounds contradictory to what i said in the neutral point. Basically its not a graphical issue, but more of a structure/placement thing. Like the tower level i mentioned previously was particularly annoying for that reason, i just couldn't see an area when i should have been able too. I call this nitpicking because it doesn't affect things to the point of being unable to play or solve any puzzles. It's a minor annoyance, but still would have been nice to be able to adjust the camera or something.\\n\\nOverall the game is super super solid. Its pretty amazing. I love puzzles and this one definitely stands out.\",\n",

Then back at the price tag and user reviews. Huh? You can\\'t even bother to try to convince me to hand over $30. Is this seriously a real thing?\\n\\nYes! And it\\'s one of the best puzzle games of the decade.\\n\\nLevel design is tight. Each one explores a very specific concept in a level that is absolutely as minimalistically, frustratingly concise as it can to be. And as a result of being so terse, most puzzles appear utterly impossible at first and you wonder if you\\'ve misunderstood the question, or overlooked a mechanic that was never illustrated. \"That would be unfair\" you think, because of all the other times puzzle games have burned you in that way. But then the solution clicks, or you sleep on it, you learn something new about the mechanics that have always existed, and you come back and solve it and move on to the next.  It\\'s harder because there is no hand holding, or retreading over past concepts just to burn up playtime hours. But it\\'s also totally fair. You always have the information necessary to solve each puzzle, and each one will take the minimum amount of time to solve once you\\'ve figured it out.\\n\\nFor a puzzle game that really has very few mechanics up its sleeve, there is a surprising amount of content. It\\'s not like you ever unlock new forks, or new kinds of sausages that only roll in certain directions or grills with temperature knobs. The tools at your disposal never change, you just learn new ways to manipulate them. By the end of the 30-some hours, every drop of blood has been milked from the concept and we\\'re left with a rock hard stone. \\n\\nGood stuff',\n",

       "  'review': 'This is easily the best puzzle game I\\'ve ever played in my life. There really are very few games like it. Stephen\\'s Sausage Roll is an incredibly polished game. The controls and mechanics are simple, yet allow for an insane amount of variety in puzzle design and playstyle. Each level of the game is challenging in its own way, from the very first level to the last. I beat this game in 21 hours, and never once was I bored. \\n\\nThe insane thing about Stephen\\'s Sausage roll is the way in which it utilizes its simplistic mechanics. While other puzzle games like Portal and Talos Principle will construct level packs around certain gimmicks (think repulsion gel and turrets), Stephen\\'s Sausage Roll introduces next to no new concepts as time goes on. There are really only four new concepts that get introduced over time, but these concepts are mechanics that already exist with the character. An example of this is walking on sausages. The character has always been able to walk on top of sausages, but this move isn\\'t required to solve any puzzles until the third \"world\". Stephens Sausage roll takes one simple concept of moving sausages onto grills, and really only does that for the entire game.\\n\\nHowever, this game isn\\'t for everyone. It really is incredibly hard. Thankfully, the game includes a rewind button, so you are never really punished for making a mistake on a puzzle. Other puzzle games would force you to restart where stephen\\'s sausage roll doesn\\'t. If this feature wasn\\'t included, I would have hated the game. The rewind button really allows you to not be afraid to make mistakes.\\n\\nOverall, I thought the game was really, really, really good. If you like hard puzzle games, this game is for you. It is easily the best puzzle game I\\'ve ever played.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Stephen Lavelle, aka increpare, has created in Stephen\\'s Sausage Roll a tidy microworld that constantly grows in logically reasonable yet unexpected ways, achieved solely by altering previously known bits of terrain. It eschews graphics, music, and story in favor of difficult puzzle gameplay, and astonishingly, the end result is one of the best games I\\'ve ever played.\\n\\nThough it may start a bit slowly, every time a \"new\" mechanic is presented, it manages to do so in such an innocuous and natural manner that once you understand how the mechanic works, it seems impossible that it wasn\\'t present in previous levels. And that\\'s the real beauty of the game: everything presented WAS in the previous levels, but just slightly past the veil, out of sight. Even in the very final stretch, there are novel presentations of mechanics that aren\\'t present in any of the previous levels. Playing this game feels like watching a magician pull objects out of a hat, or clowns coming out of a clown car; when you think there could not possibly be any more mechanics, it turns around and reveals an entire new category of possibilities.\\n\\nOverall, the levels are handcrafted to a degree of precision and exactness that I\\'ve never seen in any other puzzle game. The controls, though they\\'re pretty clunky, are tightly integrated into the level design. By restricting certain types of movement, the levels are able to have a sort of maze-like progression of moves that can be fully mentally solved before even making a move. It\\'s especially noticeable at the start of the game, where there\\'s also a much smaller margin of error than in later levels.\\n\\nAn absolute stunning display of game design.\\n',\n",

       "  'review': 'Being honest here, you probably won\\'t like this game. So if the price point is making you second guess purchasing it i\\'d suggest you skip it... at least until it goes on sale.\\n\\nEven with that being said, i can whole-heartedly reccommend this game if a brain-teaser type puzzle is what you\\'re looking for. This game is full of small puzzles (and a few intimidatingly large ones) that may have you stumped at first but soon after have you feeling damn clever for figuring them out.\\n\\nOverall, the most welcome feature in the game is it\\'s simple control scheme.  Using W/A/S/D you can move forward and backward in the direction that you\\'re facing and rotate 90 degrees to face another direction. Outside of that you have 3 other keys that allow you to quit the current puzzle with no penalty, reset the puzzle to start again, and an unlimited undo button that will allow you to undo each move that you\\'ve made all the way back to the point where you first boot the game up. But just because the control scheme is simple, that doesn\\'t mean that the gameplay is simple. In fact, one of the first things you\\'ll have to figure out is how to move about the levels effectively. \\n\\nAnd the simplicity of it all doesn\\'t come without a few surprises. At first it may appear that the only puzzle of the game is to roll and push the sausages around to get them all cooked, but then your fork comes into play more and instead of just pushing them around you have to skewer them too, and now there\\'s ladders too, and you\\'re rolling around on top of a sausage? And how did this sausage end up on my head like that? It\\'s a lot less of new and more complicated features being added, and more of encountering situations which, up until that point, hadn\\'t even come into play. The game isn\\'t teaching you anything new, you just happen to figure it out while looking for a solution.\\n\\nIf i had to give a comparison to gauge the type of gameplay you can expect from this game, I would compare it to those sliding block puzzles where you have to move all the other blocks around in the grid to get the one target block out of the gate. Its a lot of moving things around and seeing if you\\'re any closer to a solution and slowly undoing your moves to see if you missed something somewhere. It\\'s not \"exciting\" exactly, but it sure is satisfying when the solutions become apparent to you.\\n\\nAnd as always with cleverly designed puzzles, your difficulty may vary. Some may find a majority of the puzzles simple, others won\\'t be able to make heads or tails of the first collection of puzzle the game offers them. Personally, i felt stumped for a good while before everything started clicking for me, and then a puzzle that i had stepped into earlier which i felt was far too challenging for me to ever complete suddenly became a playground to practice the new assortment of tricks i had learned. And as i rolled that last sausage onto the grill, i wondered why i figured it was too difficult in the first place.',\n",

       "  'review': 'It\\'s over, I cooked my last sausage. I feel complete. I feel empty.\\n\\nStephen doesn\\'t care about the game design best practices. No tutorial here, no gradual learning curve, you\\'re thrown into an unknown world, with the first puzzles already being hard. You\\'re a stranger to this world, don\\'t expect it to be easy and welcoming. I left my first play session with a bitter taste in my mouth, hesitating to come back. This game is more expensive than it appears to be worth, and I just spent a precious time of my life cooking sausages with a ridiculously hard to control character. But I went back, passed the first island, and discovered a new game mechanic. But this mechanic wasn\\'t brought by a new item to obtain, no, it was here all along, but the environment was just not exposing it. I feel there are other mechanics, hidden, just waiting for me to discover them. I continue, eager to explore to find these mechanics, and there are a lot, and the puzzles are ingeniously crafted to extract the last bit of juice each mechanic can offer. And when you think you\\'re finished, Stephen reveals yet another mechanic, pulling it from the bottom of the sea right to your face, promising you more hours of frustrating puzzles. But no, the end is near, you feel it, and you must prove to yourself you\\'re better than these sausages, you\\'re alive, and you must complete this game. And I finished it, I waited so long for the end to come, I wanted to say \"I did it!\", but now I feel empty. These puzzles were mind-bending, always pushing me to the limits, forcing me to explore new ideas, making me go further, extending my brain capacity to think outside of the box. And this is it, every sausage is cooked, and I won\\'t benefit from another brilliant sausage-based puzzle until the day I\\'ll be cooked myself.',\n",

       "  'review': \"The Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest of spatial-planning puzzlers.  This is definitely the most substantial, most difficult and best logic puzzle game I've completed.  It's better than its classic predecessors like Sokoban and Atomix.  It's better than Braid and Limbo, two of my other favorite indie puzzlers. [Added: it's better than their acclaimed followups, The Witness and INSIDE, as well.  At least on the puzzle side.]\\n\\nThis game is a historic achievement in puzzle design.  The ground rules (the physics and the vocabulary of objects) are clear enough from early on, but their ramifications become clear only gradually as more complex situations arise.  The creator wrests a fantastic depth and variety of puzzles out of a simple ruleset, with endlessly surprising and novel solution techniques.  \\n\\nAs a result of this richness, there are (justifiably) a large number of puzzles.  You'll have to work long and hard to win.  (I think it took even longer than the 48 hours showing on my account, more like 60+.)  I felt there was a slight dip in variety/quality of puzzles in one environment---the animal-themed one---but that section was also easier than the surroundings, so it was a welcome break and not a big deal.  \\n\\nThe story-telling in this game is done by readable plaques. The story is very sparse and almost completely enigmatic for most of the way through; if you persevere, you'll eventually be rewarded with a final area that delivers a rich and satisfying (though still enigmatic) story.  No spoilers, but I felt it really delivered something original and compelling---you wouldn't guess from the silly title of the game.\\n\\n Anyway, this game should hold great appeal for any determined puzzle-solver.\",\n",

The basic movements are simple and predictable, but the puzzles made out of it are elegantly complex (also in the original sense of the word).\\n\\nThis is a game for you to spend quality time with. You will probably spend hours, days and maybe even a week or more trying to break through some of the problems proposed by the middle-game's levels. Hell, you will probably waste a good 20 or 30 minutes trying to solve the first 3 or 4 puzzles.\\n\\nFor all its difficulty, though, ALL of the puzzles come to realization not by a logical conclusion. It feels more like a powerful intuition that you can't explain how you've got. It just comes down like an epiphany. That game delivers that feeling over and over again. It is that unique.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"At first the awkward controls, basic visuals and difficult levels made this game difficult play, but after geting used to it I can see that this is one of the tightest puzzle games out there. The controls, while initially awkward, offer a more nuanced puzzle set-up that I wasn't expecting. It's not just enough to move the sausage pieces to the correct part of the board, but to navigate the player back to the starting location without messing up your solution or getting locked in. The difficulty doesn't let up, but the confusion I felt early on was replaced by a deep understanding of what the game wants from me, and the ability to rewind movements also helps allievate stress. \\n\\nThis isn't a game for everyone, but if you like moving-block puzzle games, this is perfect.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Stephen's Sausage Roll is a hard sell in many ways. The graphics are extremely blocky and simplistic, the music is mostly procedurally generated and kept in the background, and there's initially very little in terms of story or any sort of context. There's no tutorial to ease new players into the fiendishly difficult puzzles - many people with only a passing interest in the genre will likely quit after seeing just the first few levels. The vague trailer, description and hefty price tag probably don't help either.\\n\\nStill, once you strip all of that away you're left with one of the best puzzle game experiences available on Steam.\\n\\nThe basic premise for each level is that there are some sausages, some grills, and armed with your fork you must cook every sausage and return to the start to complete the level. The levels are made of tiles, and sausages are two tiles long, have two sides that require to be cooked, and cannot be overcooked or dropped into the ocean. Every level plays around with this simple premise, and almost all of them manage to introduce a new twist or encourage a different method of thinking - the game has almost no filler or tedium. This applies to the levels themselves: each level is tightly designed such that almost every traversable tile or obstacle carries some significance to the puzzle, and the later puzzles introduce a surprising amount of verticality (the '3D puzzle game' description really doesn't lie). The puzzles start off difficult and only get harder from there - you can expect to spend upwards of an hour trying to solve a single puzzle. In fact, one potential negative may be that some puzzles do appear too early relative to the player's familiarity with the game ([spoiler]one puzzle in world 2 comes to mind[/spoiler]) and may prove extremely intimidating. However, the payoff of figuring out the trick to each puzzle and solving it feels incredibly rewarding, and it does convey a real sense of progression in terms of mastering the mechanics of the game.\\n\\nAn obvious game to compare this to is The Witness. Past the graphics and exploration aspects (for which The Witness certainly wins), the underlying idea is much the same. Both games don't explicitly reveal anything about their mechanics, instead leaving it to the player to figure the rules out. This concept is as essential to the game as the puzzles themselves, but Stephen's Sausage Roll does this more subtly, only allowing the player to experiment as much as the levels accommodate for it. Unlike The Witness, which have distinct types of line puzzles, it doesn't feel like new mechanics or abilities are outright introduced to the player; rather these abilities are discovered through normal play; sometimes even on accident. It's these discoveries that lead to the most mindblowing moments of the game; it's as though an entirely new layer of the game opens up, presenting multiple avenues for more complexity and teasing many potential applications of these mechanics. There's also the story element that The Witness has taken some flak for - here the story is simpler and told far more directly, but it still manages to be surprisingly endearing [spoiler](and perhaps a little disturbing)[/spoiler].\\n\\nSo all in all, would I universally recommend this game to everyone? Absolutely not - this is a puzzle game at its purest that would appeal to a very specific niche of players, and you'll need a lot of patience and perseverance to overcome each of its challenges. If you're willing to make that commitment, then Stephen's Sausage Roll is well worth the asking price, and it may well be one of the most rewarding experiences you'll have in a puzzle game.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"This is without a question the best puzzle game ever made. Period. (In my opinion, at least). \\n\\nIf you like fiendish (but 100% fair) puzzle games, this game is definitely for you. There are zero distractions or unnecessary elements in the game and every single block of every single stage has been very deliberately placed to create a marvelous collection of levels. Don't be discouraged by the, admittedly crappy, graphics. The game is just so much more than it seems at first glance (or even at the first hour or so of playthrough), [spoiler]with a buttload of complex mechanics that, however, arise naturally from the gameplay and will make total sense when you encounter them[/spoiler]. Completing even the very first level will make you think you have accomplished something, and that feeling will only get stronger the more you progress through the game. I am fairly experienced with puzzle games, and it took me about 35 hours to complete the game (some hours were lost while playing offline)\\n\\nIf you like profound puzzle games that will stick with you for a long time, buy this game! (and if you do buy it, for the love of god DO NOT look up the solutions, no matter how long you are stuck on a level!)\\n\\nA glowing recommendation from me!\\n\\nPS. If you care about the story, the best way to describe it is, well... unconventional.\\n\",\n",

       "  'review': 'This game is truly \"all killer, no filler\".  I\\'m only 1/3 of the way through, and I can unequivocally say it\\'s one of the hardest puzzle games I\\'ve ever played.  It\\'s also by far the most rewarding!  There is zero extraneous content: it\\'s all puzzles, puzzles and more puzzles.  Puzzles are concentrated in smallish \"islands\" that are fairly compact, so there isn\\'t the running-around-looking-for-more-puzzles issue that makes The Witness a chore at times.  All the puzzles are completely fair; there are no \"environmental\" or meta-puzzles included here (at least, none that I\\'ve encountered so far).  And yet, some of the puzzles are so brutal you will be very sorely tempted to look at a walkthrough.  DON\\'T!  If you do, you will ruin your entire enjoyment of the game.  The essence of the game is trying to solve a puzzle, failing, rewinding, trying again, and over and over until you finally figure out the trick that makes this puzzle doable.  You will be 100% certain over and over again that a particular puzzle is impossible, only to solve it later.  When you do solve a tough puzzle, you will feel like the smartest person alive!  Puzzles don\\'t require brute-force trial and error but rather a way of looking at a situation with fresh eyes to see what you missed the last time.  Although I\\'m not a mathematician, I imagine that solving an SSR puzzle is a lot like proving a tough theorem, with false starts, lemmas (\"I just need to get this sausage here and then...\") and finally, enlightenment :-)  I woudn\\'t recommend this game to anyone who isn\\'t a hard-core puzzle fanatic, though, or it will drive you crazy.   If you do get it, my advice is to not worry so much about solving the puzzles at first and just concentrate on exploring the possibilities in a particular puzzle.  Sometimes you\\'ll stumble upon the right approach right away, but other times you will beat your head against a particular problem for literally days until you finally get it.   One strategy that has worked well for me is to work backwards.  Imagine what the final configuration of the sausages could be, and then figure out how to get there.  Another tip is that you should try to figure out what every part of the puzzle is there for.  I guarantee that there is nothing in any puzzle that is not necessary, so if there is some unusual part of the puzzle, you can bet that there is a good reason it has to be there.\\n\\nAlthough this game is agonizing at times, I\\'ve never played a game that was better at making me solve problems logically.  If you are a serious puzzle game fan, you absolutely have to play this game.\\n\\nEDIT: Now I\\'m about halfway through the fourth world, and I\\'d like to add another bit of advice.  Sometimes, you get it into your head that a puzzle can only be solved if you get a particular sausage into a particular configuration.  However, a lot of the time there is another way to solve the problem, and if you don\\'t let go of your preconception you will go crazy looking for something that isn\\'t there.  I know this is vague advice but it will make sense when you are banging your head against a hard puzzle.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Imagine a puzzle game where, rather than waste time on fancy graphics and characterisation, a developer channeled all of their time and energy into completely mind-opening level design. That is, at its core, what Stephen\\'s Sausage Roll is. It starts off simple enough, almost like some mobile game, however even at that early stage many of the puzzles appear to have obvious solutions that just don\\'t [i]quite[/i] work. The second area is where things start to really pick up, and for the first 5 areas, each area introduces another technique for puzzle solving. The neat thing is how these techniques come into play; the second area, for instance, introduces a trick involving an interaction between sausages and walls (I won\\'t go into more detail because it\\'ll spoil the surprise). However, in the first area you would never come upon this trick, as the first area has no walls. Areas 3, 4, and 5 introduce similarly game-changing techniques, giving the player more tools to attack the often fiendish problems the game poses. However, these 5 areas (comprising roughly 2/3 of the game in terms of sausages grilled) serve mainly as a tutorial for the final section of the game, which is filled with puzzles so original they could almost be new games by themselves. This section is reminiscent of the second half of Portal, in that the lines between individual puzzles become more and more blurred.\\n\\nThere is a narrative of sorts, although much like Portal this only really picks up during the final section, and it never interferes with gameplay in any way. I decided to wait until I finished the game before writing this review, and I\\'m pleased I did because the ending is both satisfying and conclusive (there are [spoiler]220[/spoiler] sausages in the game). In terms of difficulty i would say it is somewhere around the level of a Zachtronics game, however there\\'s a big difference in style, as the puzzles in those games don\\'t tend to have one intended solution and revolve around system design.\\n\\nIf you\\'re still wondering about the price, I have two suggestions for you:\\n[olist]\\n[*] Try to get through the first area within the refund time (should be doable, depends if you\\'re feeling smart) and go to the puzzle in the second area called \"The Tower\" (you\\'ll know it when you see it). This is the first time the game gets really interesting, and should give you a taste of what comes later.\\n\\n[*] Watch an unedited playthrough ([i] not a walkthrough [/i]) of the first area, where someone figures out how to solve the first set of puzzles. Notice how many times they get fooled into thinking there\\'s an easy option; only to find they\\'ve wound up in a dead end, and how even the smallest puzzles require quite complicated solutions. This should help with suggestion (1) if you think you need it, as well as clearly demonstrating the ingenious design of the game.\\n[/olist]\\nIn my opinion, despite its initial appearance, this is pretty much the best puzzle game there is at the moment, and i would recommend it to anyone and everyone.

       "  'review': \"Stephen's Sausage Roll is a puzzle game by Increpare. \\n\\nIn any of the puzzles, there is not a single thing to distract you from getting to the solution, not necessary the solution, but the knowledge you gain after solving a puzzle. Every little detail is put in place with great care and has a purpose to it, so much so that you can complete solution through thinking about and finding out what those details mean and where they would play a roll. Many of the levels seem pretty hard or even impossible at first, but the game lets you trust it -- it wouldn't be in the game if it were impossible. \\n\\nNo new mechanic is added throughout the game, yet the game constantly surprises you with its already rich mechanics, every substantial aspect of which plays some roll somewhere in this game. All of the mechanics are intuitive and none of them are abstract, they all connect together and except for one, none of them is independent from the rest. \\n\\nThe game frequently drives you to a state where you have to doubt everything you trusted and reconsider everything you ruled out. Many levels need not only one but several moments of epiphany, some of which wouldn't even be needed in the particular level you reach them in, but are a natural result of the interaction between your mind and the level. It takes your mind so deep in the universe of ideas and possibilities that you forget the simplest of actions once you have the solution. \\n\\nStephen's Sausage Roll is probably the best puzzle game ever made and it's a treasure full of awe. It doesn't try to deceive or distract you through fancy narrative and graphics. There is no hand-holding, no tutorial, no easy levels to make you feel you're making progress. It doesn't waste your time, yet there is more than enough time to be spent solving all the puzzles. It's filled with as much precious content as possible. There is no secret mechanic, hidden area or unnecessary complexities that make you feel betrayed. With all its difficulties, everything you need is in front of you. It's as honest and true as a game can be.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"This is the best puzzle game ever made in terms of mechanics, and it's not even close. You can finish it in 36 hours, and that's 36 hours of zero messing around. This game doesn't ask for the same solution twice, not ever. The game starts with almost zero instructions and literally every single detail has a reason for existing, even the controls. The controls are a bit odd and take some time to learn, but mastering them is part of the experience. After going to the first level there's already a massive difficulty spike and I can't even call it that because the game really is the most difficult puzzle game in the world that also manages to be fair and smart. You have a rewind button for every move and a reset, but no hints. After beating each puzzle you really feel like you learned something that the developer intended for you to learn, and that thing usually doesn't appear a second time unless it's really basic. \\n\\nEven though this is a 10/10 game and the masterpiece of it's genre I absolute cannot recommend it if you don't have the following criteria: you need to be really smart and have a solid background in puzzle games. Otherwise you literally won't be able to finish the game on your own (which is the whole point), and you are going to reach a wall really quickly because of it (maybe in the first minutes).\",\n",

Don't be misled by people calling it hard; the designs are such that a puzzle will first appear impossible, but experimenting will gradually teach you the concepts necessary to solve it.

       "  'review': 'This is a puzzle game that is a lot of fun. There are 87 levels in total, and every level throws a wrench at you at a different angle; i.e., every level has you doing something unique, some new orientation you haven\\'t tried before or just a completely new mechanic. You will occasionally get frustrated by the lack of instructions and the forced mousing around to find/master a new game mechanic, but perhaps these annoyances are necessary to better enjoy the full flavor of the game? The controls are simple: just WASD or arrow keys, but these simple controls are complexified by way of the terrain and, of course, the requirement of cooking the sausages.\\n\\nIs it worth 29.99 USD? I beat the game in 29 hours, which meant that I basically paid 1 dollar every hour to play. Yes, that was worth it to me. Although I am sure you could pick it up cheaper later on (It was in the Humble Bundle once).\\n\\nAs you play the game you notice that you will master old techniques that you were utterly confused by earlier, but even if you try to understand all of the mechanics you have previously been shown, nearly every puzzle requires a new way of thinking--whether that be through rolling, pushing, spoking, or causing fall a sausage. \\n\\nOne of the great things about this game is that each level is compact. This means that you can get a map of the current level in your head. When you exit the game, if you are like me, you will be thinking of ways to overcome the level in your head when you are not playing--I used a pen and paper during my work lunches to solve some of the harder levels! And I wouldn\\'t be surprised if many others did too.\\n\\nThere is a story to the game, but it is connected by loose straws. The story is made to be strange, and to attempt to give reason as to why you are rolling giant sausages on a remote island. When you complete the game it may be fun to read fan theories about the story.\\n\\nI was thoroughly entertained during my playthrough, and I do recommend it to those persons who are interested in \"a simple 3d puzzle game.\"',\n",

I don't want to sound like I'm parroting Jon Blow and his praise for the game, but it's honestly literally true.\\n\\nIt really feels like the guy who designed these puzzles is right there, daring you solve it, and it feels so good when you finally figure out the solution. There are some puzzles that are basically elaborate jokes at your expense (if you've cultivated a bad habit over the previous few puzzles, he makes sure you learn never to repeat that again). Some levels are really intimidating but actually have such simple solutions, and then vice versa. The way new mechanics are introduced feels so natural, and sometimes leaves you shocked that a thing you thought was impossible is actually routinely expected of you now.\\n\\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys puzzle games and isn't afraid of a challenge.\",\n",

Some seem simple at first, but turn out to be really tricky as you'll end up burning a section of a sausage even though you've thought out how to maneouver it. The difficulty makes it all the more satisfying to clear a section of the map. Every so often, a new technique is introduced, such as skewering, and it's done in such a great dialogue-free way that fits into the game.\\n\\nIf you're not a fan of legitimately hard puzzles, then it's not for you. Don't be that guy who gets the game, complains that the puzzles 'make no sense' or that it's unintuative, then downvote it due to your own stupidity. It's not the game's fault.

The game is teaching you concepts, but it is also allowing you to employ those concepts, so there are a ton of puzzles available to solve. While I have exited a puzzle and searched for other puzzles to solve to gain more confidence, then returned and solved the puzzle, a player is going to have to solve EVERY puzzle to progress. Which makes the pacing very slow. This lack of incentive to move forward and the high level of spatial thinking means you have to take a deep breath, sip at a cup of coffee, and get mentally prepared when you hit that Start button.\\n\\nBut, it\\'s oh so worth it.

       "  'review': 'After a mind-distortingly frustrating first hour, I have to conclude that this game is too difficult for me.  It took me a good 5 to 10 minutes just to figure out where the first puzzle was.  The first one I happened to encunter had 3 sausages on it and I had no clue what I was supposed to do with them.  Eventually I gave up and found another one with 2 sausages.  Still clueless.  I gave up and found what must be the intended first puzzle, and finally ascertained what you\\'re supposed to do with these sausages.  I then looked around and found each puzzle containing only 1 sausage and was able to complete them.  Then I started looking for the ones that had 2 sausages, and it started to get very frustrating again.  After my first hour, I completed maybe 5 or 6 total puzzles.\\n\\nThis game does NOT hold your hand, or explain anything to you, and there is only like 3 puzzles that are truly \"beginner\" level.  It ramps up in complexity and difficulty FAST after that.\\n\\nAt it\\'s root, the puzzles are kind of like those sliding puzles you might have played before, where you need to move pieces around in a confined space, sliding them into empty spaces and pushing them against each other to complete the picture.  Only in this game, as you move the pieces around, there is a mechanic (I don\\'t want to spoil it because I was legitimately shocked and had a \"eureka\" moment when I first discovered what exactly you\\'re even supposed to do!) that \"disables\" your ability to move the pieces in certain ways into certain spaces.  Your movements are therefore more limited than you\\'d otherwise have in a sliding piece puzzle. So you have to get things lined up and make all the right moves from the very beginning of each puzzle, or else you make it impossible and have to rewind or start over to get it right.  Often you don\\'t know that the move you\\'ve just made (could even be the first move in the whole puzzle) makes it impossible to solve, but you don\\'t discover that until 20 moves later that there is no way to complete it, and even then you may do it 20 different ways before realizing that it was that very first move that you were getting wrong all along.\\n\\nThe game does have a rewind feature to undo moves instead of having to start over, but often it\\'s just easier to completely start over.\\n \\nThere is a certain logic and tactic to doing these puzzles that my brain just isn\\'t getting.  I struggled intensely to finish the easiest couple of levels in the game, and then hit a total wall and felt angry and feustrated for the next 15 minutes being unable to find another puzzle I could complete.  So after close to an hour I have given up, and I\\'m not sure I\\'ll ever go back.  It just feels way more difficult than I was expecting or that I feel capable of doing.\\n\\nFor the record, I love puzzle games, and have completed every puzzle in The Witness, Talos Principle, Portal 1 & 2, etc without looking at any guides, but this puzzler just pummels you with a very steep difficulty right at the beginning.  At least, for me.',\n",

       "  'review': 'The game is very, very hard from the very start. The progression in difficulty after the beginning is reasonable, but the game begins with a difficulty cliff that is frankly mystifying. It would have been very easy to throw in a half dozen puzzles that explored the basic mechanics at the same pace that future puzzles expand on them. The only explanation I can think of is the hope that reviewers would fawn over the difficulty fetishism - and I guess the gambit worked since that\\'s the main thing anyone seems to say about it.\\n\\nIn general, the game has brilliant ideas, asking you to make some brilliant intuitive leaps. When it works, it\\'s very interesting, and it will keep impressing you with how far it can stretch the puzzles without giving you anything more than the fork you start with.\\n\\nUnfortunately, most of the best ideas are trapped in sokoban-style games that feel more like the Tower of Hanoi than they do The Witness. All of the really brilliant intuitive leaps are trapped beneath a wet blanket of time spent figuring out the particular sequence of moves that you more or less understand - you\\'ll frequently find yourself working through a level, figuring out the \"trick\", and then sighing as you resign yourself to figuring out the particular sequence for the rest of the level.\\n\\nIt feels like all of the really interesting insights come at the cost of an awful lot of tedium. All of the new and intriguing concepts are stuck behind a lot of sokoban that is not particularly novel or fun.\\n\\nIf you enjoy sokoban, this game is probably an absolute delight. If you don\\'t, I don\\'t think the legitimately smart elements of the game are worth the time spent on far less stimulating aspects of the puzzles.',\n",

I'm saying no because this has a steep learning curve and the puzzles demand a level of spatial reasoning that I must lack because I've spent over an hour with it and only solved a few of the levels.  I wish this game had a tutorial that eased you into it more easily and taught you all of the different techniques you need to win.  It's just too frustrating for me, but I can see why others enjoy it.  I even had friends download the demo and attempt it and they were too triggered to play for more than 15 minutes.  I'm not going to refund because I like the art style and I will return to it from time to time to see if I can actually learn to play this game without getting mad.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Fantastic game for people that enjoy mulling over logical puzzles. I have horrid spatial abilities yet I'm around 70% through the game. Sure, lots of levels are difficult but no special skills are required other than logic and deduction. Each level is small and has a trick or skill to learn in order to progress. New mechanics appear organically as a product of messing around and solving each level feels like a victory. \\n\\nLots of reviews focus on the price, stating that $30 is too high for an indie puzzle game. I bought the game for $10 through a humble bundle and even then I tossed up for a few days as to whether it would be worth it or if I would enjoy the game. SSR was totally worth the money I spent and easily worth $30 asking price. SSR has no levelling, no forraging for items to craft together and no filler components - just pure gameplay. So many games have hours of tutorials, waves of repetitive gameplay, weak endgames or gameplay locked behind DLC. Even The Witness asked the player to traverse a gigantic (admittedly beautiful) island for hours on end in order to find more line puzzles and a clip from a Tarkovsky movie. \\n\\nPaying $30 is a small tradeoff for such a rewarding gameplay experience. If you're on the fence about it BUY IT and do yourself a favour - give it a few hours. All of the negative reviews seems to be from people who played for under and hour and gave up.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I bought Stephen's Sausage Roll because Jonathan Blow said it might be the best puzzle game ever made, and while I don't really agree with that, I do think it may well be the most perfectly designed puzzle game ever. \\n\\nThe gameplay consists of rolling sausages which are 2x1x1 spaces such that each quadrant of the suasage (top and bottom of both spaces) touches a grill space exactly once. You do this by moving your avatar, a 1x1x1 person holding a 1x1x1 fork, forwards and backwards and rotating left and right. Despite that description, the control scheme is relative to the player, not the avatar, which was mildly infuriating to me at first but serves to make the mechanics more congruous later on. The game doesn't so much introduce new mechanics to you as much as help you accidentally discover them, and each flows naturally from the base mechanic in such a way that you'll wonder if you didn't already know them and just hadn't had an opportunity to use them yet. All of the levels are intertwined when navigating the world, but when you enter one the rest of the world drops away leaving only the relevant bits.

You\\'ll do it, you\\'ll like it, and ask for seconds... Psst, dude, don\\'t worry, you got this\".\\n\\nThere\\'s several points in the game where the difficulty seems to jump too high, and yeah, watch that step, it\\'s a doozy, but half the challenge of them is just overcoming how daunting the task is. If you beat The Great Tower, you\\'re ready for anything the game will throw at you, I don\\'t care how dumb you are, all you need is courage. \\n\\nThe game rewards being adventurous and trying out bizzarre things, mostly because of the brilliant undo system, but also because the simple mechanics you learn on the first level are more far-reaching than you would give them credit for.',\n",

       "  'review': '\"It does what it says on the tin.\" Great spatial reasoning puzzle game. Long, challenging, and rewarding. You walk around in a small open world and solve puzzles. Introduces new mechanics through discovery. For example, some puzzles are designed so that you\\'ll accidentally notice that you can do something with the sausages even though it\\'s not part of the solution. A few puzzles later, that thing you stumbled upon before will be the main mechanic for a series of puzzles. The game is very hard, but some reviewers and websites try to exagerate the difficulty to be dramatic. The first few puzzles are not that bad despite many people saying you could get stuck and quit on the first puzzle; I don\\'t think that\\'s true at all. A handful of the puzzles later in the game will probably stump you for an 1-3 hours, but the rest you will figure out in 10-30 mins or so. Tons of people seem to think the tower puzzle near the beginning of the game is really hard and maybe a deal breaker or something. It is intimidating, but it\\'s also really obvious what you need to do and you just need to mess around a bit to make it happen. There is a small bit of story to add flavor to what you are doing too. Controls are purposefully weird, but since that type of control is built into the puzzle design, it works. Great game overall, it felt like a great achievement to finally beat it (took me 35 hours). Graphics are great too; this isn\\'t a game with hyper-simple graphics like it might first appear, there is actually a ton of detail going on.',\n",

       "  'review': \"With sadness, I must say I do not recommend this. Partly because I'm not into sliding puzzles. Partly because I dont' like that the game refuses to explain pretty much any mechanic. You spend the entire first island pushing and rolling the sausages. On the second island, you need to know that standing on one, it will move under you like a log roll. And if you push the skewers into one that cannot move, you skewer it and can drag it about.\\n\\nI had to look up whether the story could make it worth playing a game where I'm basically going to be watching someone smarter than I playing it and copying their moves. It's depressing as hell.\\n\\nIf you like really goddamn hard sliding puzzles? Sure. Go for it.\\n\\nBut Dark Souls games have better tutorials, and frustrate me less.\\n\\n\\nEdit: Also, why the frell is this $30? I got this in a humble bundle. This is a minimalist 3D sliding block puzzle with a lack of tutorial or hints. Gawds. Even if this thing is your jam? It ain't $30 good.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'IF YOU HAVE TIME AND PASSION TO CONCENTRATE IN PUZZLES, YOU SHOULD BUY THIS. \\n\\nI just cleared this game and saw the ending. Here\\'s my comments about the characteristics of the game. And I don\\'t want to spoil anything about the final chapter of the game, after the \"Dead End\" puzzle, which is my favorite. You should feel the same shock with that specific puzzle. \\n\\n\\n- This game features NO TUTORIAL PUZZLES for any of the mechanics. Instead it throws one of the harder puzzles one can make with that mechanics on your face as soon as a new mechanic is introduced. This means every single level is challenging. I mean SUPER DUPER HARD. Sometimes you\\'ll waste more than 30 minutes as soon as entering one puzzle to think about, like, \\'Is this possible? Seriously, I don\\'t even see any move I can make.\\' Especially in the last world. \\n\\n- Though, all of the mechanisms are surprizingly and EXTREMELY INTUITIVE and doesn\\'t need any further explanations. This is very important and it\\'s the most satisfying point for me. It follows rules of physics very well (but you have to take care of the physics, like the law of action and reaction). \\n\\n- The game DOES NOT feature any new rule at any instance of the game. It does feature new mechanics for each chapter, but they are not new rules. Like, you are able to walk on the sausages or turn around with a sausage on your head, which is nicely intuitive. But you can\\'t turn around with sausages on your fork or step into midair, rules are never changed or added. Also no new objects are introduced. There are the player character, sausages, solid blocks and grills only. \\n\\n- Puzzles are excellently designed, every single block (or hole) is there for a reason. Feels like a genious designed the puzzles.  Most of the puzzles make you to think outside of the box. Sometimes you\\'ll find out the puzzle is impossible to solve from your knowledge. Try to do some weird moves, or moves that you thought it sets the puzzle stuck. Furthermore, even if you did come up with the idea, the puzzle remains hard. This is not the kind of the game that you can solve in 1 minute after you find the trick. \\n\\n- The story was very interesting and fun to me. The story really begins in the last chapter so you don\\'t need to rush. It\\'s simple, weird and satisfying (maybe it\\'s only me). I also love the ending. Yeah. \\n\\n- You can\\'t redo puzzles you\\'ve already solved directly. However you can use \\'load game\\' menu to take yourself to whatever auto-save you want to, so it doesn\\'t matter so much. (Thanks for [SeHa] j0bs of pointing this out)\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter all, this is one of the best puzzle games I\\'ve ever played. It stands with Witness or Recursed in my mind.',\n",

If you like difficult puzzles you should like it!\\n\\nFirst, I just completed the game after 24 hours of magnificient puzzle solving and I can now say that this is my favorite puzzle game of all time! It's so so so so so so so good!!\\n\\nIt is a lot bigger than it seems, in terms of size but also in terms of what you can do. It starts as a simple game where you need to move sausages around Sokoban style, but once in a while it will surprise you with a new mechanic you didn't expect. The game doesn't tell you anything about how it works, you have to figure it all out, and it is great!\\n\\nIt's also the type of puzzle where you'll get stuck on a puzzle for a couple of days and then all of a sudden you'll figure it out while doing the laundry or brushing your teeth and you'll rush to the computer to test your theory. The design of the puzzles are simple enough that you can continue trying to solve them in your head after closing the game, but definitely complicated enough that you'll spend hours on some of the puzzles.\\n\\nAnyway, if you want more information you can read the other reviews here, but the less you know the more fun you'll have!! And at the time of writing this, 99% of the reviews are positive, so if you like puzzles, you can't go wrong with this one, it's freakin' AMAZING!!\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Whether or not you think this game is worth $30 heavily depends on how smart you are and how easily you get frustrated. I can totally picture someone buying this and not being able to solve a single puzzle after a couple hours. It\\'s that hard. It\\'s blindfolded Rubik\\'s Cube hard. I think the high price is specifically to discourage all but the most hardcore puzzle gamers from trying it. If the game were more accessible, there\\'d be much more negative reviews from people who had no clue how to roast a single set of sausages successfully.\\n\\nThis is not one of those games that makes you feel really clever most of the time you\\'re playing it like The Witness or The Talos Principle. This game makes you feel stupid and overwhelmed with deceptively simple-looking puzzles until you actually manage to reason your way through it. Every puzzle I thought \"Woah, I have NO clue where to even start, I\\'ll leave this one for later and go to one of the easier ones\" before realizing that WAS one of the easy ones. If you are a brilliant person (or think you are), this will be a good way to test your reasoning and spacial abilities.\\n\\nI picked it up in a humble bundle for $10 and am glad I finally got a chance to experience the game for myself without spoiling any of the solutions. This is one of those games I honestly don\\'t think I could complete if I had a hundred years and two equally smart people helping me, but I\\'m interested to see how far I can get.',\n",

This demands a little more patience than I ordinarily have, but I was starting to appreciate the design as I acclimatized to it.\\n\\nThen I arrived at The Great Tower level (in only the second subsection of the overworld), which all at once foists about 4 times more pieces on you than you've dealt with previously, while simultaneously introducing a Z-axis and the concept of using pieces as platforms mid-puzzle.\\n\\nSSR does have a well-executed and forgiving Undo function with basically unlimited storage which is a great thing to have up until the time spent rewinding would outweigh the time spent to simply restart the puzzle and do over; the only way it could be made practical on a level that large would be if you had a full-on timeline scrubber like in the rerelease of Duke Nukem 3D.\\n\\nThere's patience, there's logic, and then there's [b]this.[/b] I play puzzle games to try and [i]relieve[/i] stress, not the other way round. It's a solid design, and I'd probably recommend it to the REALLY die-hard logicians and puzzle fanatics.

You might look at the trailer or start a level and think \"This game looks easy, I got this no sweat!\" ...but the game will taunt you as you get stumped on each and every level.\\n+ The gameplay is pretty simple and easy to learn. The goal is to cook sausages on the burner. You must cook the sausage once on both sides to complete the level. If you cook them twice or knock the sausage into the water you lose. \\n+ \"Undo button\" which allows you to easily traceback your steps without having to restart the level from the beginning.\\n+ Very challenging, great for veteran puzzle solvers. One thing that makes the game so hard is that each level is on a very small grid which limits your available moves severely. One wrong move and you will be in deadlock, so you have to carefully plan out each move.\\n+ relaxing soundtrack\\n+ Just a personal note, but this is one of those game that you have a friend or family member play and laugh at them while they sturggle to get past the first few levels.\\n\\n- The game is incredibly difficult from start to finish. This may throw off casual players who will likely not finish 5 levels before giving up.\\n- I feel like the movement controls could be improved a bit. Sometimes you want to turn around, but your characters will turn in the oppisite direction causing you to accidentally hit a sausage, which can be a bit annoying.\\n\\n\\n[Side Note: I seldem mention price points in my reviews, but this game is currently priced at $30!... that\\'s a bit steep and may impact how much you enjoy the game]',\n",

       "  'review': '\"A simple 3D puzzle game\" is an apt description - simplicity is where its greatness lies. It is notorious for being difficult, but while it can take a bit of time to figure out the rules that govern the movement of your character and the sausages (some of these rules feel a bit arbitrary), after you do the difficulty gradient is negative. It felt like the middle of the game was where it peaked in difficulty.\\n\\nThe game allows you an infinite stack of undos, since it\\'s easy to make a puzzle unsolvable. The best puzzles are those where you really have to use constructive reasoning to rule out sets of possible moves, and there are lots of puzzles like that. For some others the trick is relatively simple and it feels more like trial and error as you try to avoid moving sausages to inaccessible positions, particularly towards the end of the game.\\n\\nThe level design is consistently creative. Each level feels genuinely different from the last; the game only repeats tricks to introduce new ones. To top it off, each level is integrated into a huge overworld; on activating a puzzle, the unnecessary land drops away and you are left with some sausages to roll and a grill. The overworld is fun to explore, and the freedom to tackle puzzles - within an area - in the order you choose means you can postpone difficult puzzles for later. Without the overworld the game simply wouldn\\'t be as interesting, or as user-friendly.\\n\\nThe graphics are as you see. Crude, but for a game like this, the most important thing is that it\\'s easy on the eyes. The music is subdued and soothing. The game is relaxing to play and doesn\\'t try to assault your senses.\\n\\nIs £20 a misguided price for this game? Yes. Do you get your money\\'s worth of utility from it? Absolutely. It\\'s quite a long game, and you get to solve puzzles which genuinely require thought.\\n\\nI played the DRM-free version and I think I spent about 20 hours finishing it, give or take 5. You can get both the DRM-free version and a Steam key for the same price, and they share the same directory for save data.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Stephen\\'s Sausage Roll must be one of the purest puzzle games to come around in years. It is 100% created for its mechanics and the way they are incorporated into the staggering amount of puzzles is sheerly baffling. \\n\\nSomehow each level showcases a new concept. This is an incredbile feat as there are no \"powerups\",\\nspecial keyboard prompts or any other standard gaming conventions to promote variety: the sausages, fork and Stephen are all that are needed. \\n\\nThis game is not for the feint of heart. The begining levels are likely to take upwards of 5 to 10 minutes each to figure out how to properly navigate a perfectly cooked sausage and it is very likely some puzzles will take hours to solve. There is not an unfair puzzle, no red herrings or cheap tricks, just pure rational problem solving.\\n\\nThe puzzles in this game have two general ways of being solved. The first is organically as you move around the level. Slowly you\\'ll see movements that will get you closer and closer to your goal, its then just up to putting those movements in the correct order. Its a very satisfying feeling slowly building up your understanding of the puzzle until you can see the whole picture and have those tasty sausages pop away. \\n\\nThe second way problems get solved is by uncovering the underlying mechanics of the game and this is where it truely shines. There are no tutorials to teach you any mechanic other then moving and rewinding mistakes, a flawless mercy that lets you undo any action step by step for as long as the current play session (or if there is another limitation I\\'ve never expeienced it after rewinding dozens of minutes away just by holding down a single button). Its so well implimented that you can even undo exiting a level, making sure all those minutes of sausage rolling will never be in vein. Every time you discover a \"new\" mechanic is a moment of awe as your brain tries to process how many new possibilites this new option will provide. Do yourself a favour and never, NEVER, look any puzzle up. There are logical solutions to all of them and you will eventually be able to create it; a moment that will give you pure bliss until the next puzzle.\\n\\nThe art style at first feels very basic but the more time you spend with this game the more you understand the benefits of its simplicity. Everything has been created to make the best possible puzzle expeience and this art style allows for a clear sense of spacing for all aspects of the level as well as being able to frame most levels so that they fit in one screen. The little details like particle effects on flowers, the day-night cycle, the different sound effects for everything and even the music all show the attention to detail that this game went through. \\n\\nAll in all this is one of the greatest examples of not only the puzzle genre but of games in general. If more games could treat their mechanics with such care and expand them as far as Stephen\\'s Sausage Roll the industry could only benefit. \\n',\n",

I knew that two worlds into the game. Why? Let me tell ya.\\n\\nEverything about the design of this game is amazing. Yeah, it\\'s varied and ingenious every step of the way, it teaches you new mechanics without needing to explicitly tell you them and it makes you think outside the box constantly. But above all, the design of the game is KIND. Some puzzles games make me tear my hair and curse the people who could\\'ve crafted the nightmares before me. But in SSR, whenever I got stuck, I just sat back and asked: \"What am *I* missing? Why can\\'t *I* see it?\" \\n\\nThe solution (solutions, sometimes) is never obscure, and it never makes you feel like \"oh, how I was I supposed to get that?\" after a level. All the solutions make sense and feel good to execute, leading to such a feeling of satisfaction that SSR should probably be classed as a drug. And like a drug, I got addicted right quick, playing every day and never getting bored of it. The difficulty is very consistent throughout, starting of challenging and gently bobbing up and down, and the way the environment is woven into the puzzle solving is nothing short of mind-blowing.\\n\\nI\\'m not going to talk about the mechanics of the game. You push sausages around. There are other reviews for that, if you really need more information. I\\'m just here to recommend the game to anyone who likes puzzles game and who doesn\\'t despise games where you push objects around. This is a design MASTERPIECE, and I would gladly have paid triple the original prize. \\n\\nBuy this. Now.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Before I start this review, let me make something very clear: this is a puzzle game lover\\'s puzzle game. 99% of the enjoyment that this game has to offer is simply the excitement that comes when you finally figure out how to solve a difficult puzzle. There is no form of progression in the game other than moving from one puzzle to the next, and the graphics, music, and story, while fitting for the purpose, are minimal. So, if you require some form of external motivation to stay interested in a puzzle game, I can safely say this game is not for you.\\n\\nGot that? Good. Now I can talk about why Stephen\\'s Sausage Roll is the greatest puzzle game I\\'ve ever played, and what exactly it does that makes it so great.\\n\\nThe creator of the game, Stephen Lavelle, is no stranger to puzzle games. He has released hundreds of short, experimental games, including many puzzle games, on [url=http://www.increpare.com/]his website[/url] for free. He also released a previous commercial puzzle game, English Country Tune, which is available on Steam. He even created an open-source puzzle game engine called PuzzleScript, which many other game developers have used to create simple web-based puzzle games. But it\\'s clear that Stephen\\'s Sausage Roll is his most ambitious project to date.\\n\\nAt first, it seems ridiculous that this game could have possibly been four years in the making. When you first boot up the game, you are greeted by a silly menu theme and a title screen that looks like it was made in 15 minutes in Photoshop, complete with stock fonts. Combined with the absurd topic of the game (who in their right mind would make a game about [i]sausages[/i]?), you might begin to suspect that the entire game and its surrounding praise is just an elaborate inside joke if you didn\\'t know better. But as soon as you create your save file and enter the overworld map, you begin to realize what makes this game special.\\n\\nThe first aspect of the game that immediately strikes you is the player character\\'s movement. The only keys used for movement are the arrow keys, but it as not as simple as a press on one of those keys creating a movement in that direction. Your character wields a giant fork as big as the character itself, and while it is invaluable in helping push sausages around, it also restricts the ways that you can move. If you want to move in a direction that is perpendicular to the direction that your fork is pointing towards, you first have to rotate your fork so that the fork is now parallel to the direction you want to move in. At first, this system can feel clunky and frustrating, and simply entering the puzzles on the map may prove to be a challenge, as you have to align yourself and your fork with the ghosts on the map in order to enter the corresponding puzzle. After a while, though, the movement system begins to feel natural, and you get to appreciate the depth that this system allows for.\\n\\nWhen you do manage to enter a puzzle and the surrounding terrain falls away to leave room for the level, you realize the second aspect of the game that stands out: that it\\'s really, really, hard. The goal of each puzzle is simply to grill each sausage on the level to perfection, with no square inch of the sausage raw or burnt. A sausage takes up an area of 2 by 1 tiles, with each tile of the sausage having a top and bottom that can be grilled separately for a total of 4 cookable segments. The sausages can be grilled on the various grill tiles in the level, and each segment must touch the grill tile only once in order for it to be perfectly cooked. Despite the simplicity of these rules (which are actually not even stated in the game, you would normally have to figure them out through trial and error), the puzzles that are created with them are fiendishly difficult. It is all too easy to accidentally push a sausage into the surrounding water when trying to move, burn a sausage by moving it in a direction you shouldn\\'t have, or get yourself in a situation where it is impossible to progress because you placed a sausage in a location where you can\\'t retrieve it. You mercifully get unlimited undos to reverse any mistakes you made, but oftentimes the biggest challenge is figuring out how to get the sausages to the grills in the first place, and that is where the game\\'s design comes into its own.\\n\\nStephen\\'s Sausage Roll descends from an old Japanese computer game called Sokoban, which literally means \"warehouse keeper\". In Sokoban, you have to push crates onto their required target locations to complete each level, similarly to how you push sausages onto grills in Stephen\\'s Sausage Roll. Despite this heritage, Stephen\\'s Sausage Roll plays very differently from Sokoban. Sokoban\\'s levels are highly claustrophobic due to their narrow corridors and the inability to push more than one crate at once. By contrast, Stephen\\'s Sausage Roll\\'s levels tend to have few walls, and you are able to push more than one sausage at once. More importantly, though, while Sokoban\\'s challenge tends to come from figuring out the exact sequence of pushes required to complete the level, Stephen\\'s Sausage Roll\\'s challenge comes from figuring out a broader concept that arises from the game\\'s mechanics.\\n\\nStephen\\'s Sausage Roll only introduces new gameplay elements once per world, and the new gameplay elements feel like a natural consequence of the existing ruleset rather than something that was added because the existing puzzles were getting boring. For example, the second world introduces walls that you can stab sausages against, allowing for a new method of transporting them that helps get them out of sticky situations, but also prevents you from rotating your fork. The third world explores the consequences of adding a third dimension to the game, letting you roll on sausages by getting on top of them and letting you stack sausages on top of each other, but also introducing three-dimensional obstacles that are even more fiendish than the ones before. Despite the simplicity of these additions, the different challenges and strategies that they allow for are vast, and the possibilities are always fully explored before adding another mechanic to the game.\\n\\nAs of this writing, the game costs a full thirty US dollars, so some might be worried about the amount of content that you get for the price. Fortunately, there are many hours of enjoyment you can get out of the game. I like to think that I\\'m pretty good at puzzle games, and it took me 32 hours to finish every puzzle in the game. That\\'s less than a dollar per hour, which is a very good value proposition for anybody who enjoys their time with puzzle games. There are actually only 86 puzzles in the game, which doesn\\'t seem like a lot, but that only speaks to how well-crafted the puzzles in the game are. There are no \\'filler\\' puzzles that are just basic applications of principles that you already knew, and puzzles aren\\'t wasted to teach you those principles without providing a significant challenge, either. Every single puzzle will give you that \\'aha!\\' moment that is the joy of all puzzle game fans.\\n\\nIn conclusion: if you enjoy puzzle games, then Stephen\\'s Sausage Roll is a must-play. The puzzles may be very difficult, but if you persist long enough to solve them on your own, the feeling of satisfaction you\\'ll get from them is unrivaled. And for those who think games today are too dumbed down: this is probably the least dumb game you\\'ll ever play. Be ready to think [b]a lot[/b] when you play this game!',\n",

       "  'review': 'In my opinion, this is the best puzzle game ever made. Nothing else even comes close.\\n\\nNot a single puzzle is filler. The difficulty curve is harsh because you\\'re expected to learn fast (though this is not a completely good thing). Every puzzle introduces a new idea. Naturally, some puzzles will turn out to be easier than others, since you\\'ll come across some of these ideas on your own. But you won\\'t come across all of them, and the game will astound you with how much depth its simple set of mechanics holds. Every time you discover something on your own, and you say to yourself, \"Wow, I wonder if there\\'ll be a puzzle that takes advantage of this trick\"? There will. There always will.\\n\\nNot a single puzzle is cheap. They all stretch your understanding of the world and the mechanics just a little bit, sure, but no big rule is ever introduced without being first shown to you in a safe, straightforward environment. There won\\'t be a mechanics switch in the middle of the game where your expertise in one area of sausage-rolling will become irrelevant. There will be plenty of puzzles where you say \"I think I could make (some situation that I\\'ve never seen before) occur. What would happen if I do that?\" and then sometimes, when you do that, you\\'ll find that you\\'ve solved the puzzle. Stephen\\'s Sausage Roll does manage to be astonishingly creative in the ways it bends its mechanics, but these ways never really felt very annoying because they were always extremely consistent at their core.\\n\\nNot a single puzzle is annoying. Once you figure out the core idea, then it\\'s very straightforward to perform the correct set of actions and solve the puzzle. There\\'s no mechanical skill at all. There\\'s no huge puzzle where you have to do ten things in a specific order. There\\'s no irrelevant garbage that will get you stuck looking down an incorrect path. There\\'s an undo button and a restart button, both well-implemented (you can even undo a restart), so making a mistake is okay. The hard part is meant to be figuring out the puzzle, and ONLY that.\\n\\nAnd finally: not a single puzzle is condescending. They expect a lot from you, and each puzzle is basically the hardest possible puzzle that can be made using its specific idea. Once again, there are zero red herrings in this game, and an idea is never repeated twice. That\\'s pretty damn impressive.\\n\\nThe game\\'s graphics are blocky and very vibrant, which makes it super easy to see what\\'s going on everywhere. The music is kind of nondescript atmospheric stuff, good for really long stretches of thinking. The sounds are cute and used sparingly and appropriately.\\n\\nThis game isn\\'t perfect. It\\'s a very linear game towards the end, and frequently you\\'ll have only one puzzle to do. I wish you could take a break from later puzzles and try out other ones when you\\'re stuck. The early game does a much better job of this.\\n\\nStill, I recommend this game whole-heartedly. It\\'s head and shoulders above anything else I\\'ve ever seen.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I was on the verge of refunding this game within the first hour of playtime. I couldn't cook a single sausage. I went back, gave it another chance, and finally cooked one. Then another. And another. I always felt like I was one eureka moment away from unlocking some grander truth about each sausage I just simply couldn't figure out how to cook, as well as the island that contained all of them. And for the most part, I was. And that moment came over and over until all the sausages were perfectly cooked.\\n\\nMost of the puzzles are constructed to teach you something new about the game and how to play it. In a way, even though this game is deviously hard at times (most of the time), it spurs you onward. Most puzzle games are content to be difficult and inscrutable, easily causing the player to toss them aside in frustration. So much care has gone into each of the puzzles in this game that it feels like the solution is just beyond your reach, so you rarely go into a puzzle without having any real idea of how to go about things. There are some stumbling blocks, sure, but if you take the time and effort to just observe and experiment, you're bound to find something that can help you cook those damned sausages.\\n\\nStephen's Sausage Roll is likely the hardest puzzle game I will ever complete. There have been harder puzzle games, but none that have spurred me onward to see it through to the end.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'First off, this game is *difficult*. But it\\'s a fair difficulty if you have experience with puzzles. If you don\\'t have prior experience but want a difficult puzzle game you can actually complete, you would be better off playing either English Country Tune or Snakebird first. Go ahead and pick up those two titles first, and complete them. Those are easier than this, but still quite difficult for a first-timer.\\n\\nNow, a review for those of us who are actually experienced in puzzle games (but somehow haven\\'t bought this?).\\n\\nStephen\\'s Sausage Roll is a puzzle game that, first and foremost, prides itself on having some of the most ludicrously difficult puzzles, yet having merely a small handful of fairly simple rules. Think Fish Fillets, Hana no Puzzle, and Snakebird. You play as the titular Stephen, who has crashed her ship on the Island of Wisdom and must presumably find her way back home. However, the island is strange; it has sand and grass as you\\'d expect from an island, but it also has mysterious pink cubes, metal grilles, and ghostly versions of Stephen herself.\\n\\nOh, and Stephen for some reason holds a giant fork. Don\\'t ask why, because I don\\'t know. Maybe that\\'s her ship\\'s anchor or something.\\n\\nAt this point, you\\'re probably wondering what the gameplay is like. I understand; the trailer doesn\\'t show anything, you don\\'t want to spoil yourself too much by reading reviews on external sites, but you\\'re not sure if this game really is worth the 23GBP. So I\\'ll say this much:\\n\\nThe pink cubes are sausages, the metal grilles are grills, and you have to grill each sausage by pushing them onto the grills. Take care not to burn them or lose them in the water. It\\'s like Sokoban, but more difficult due to the giant fork that Stephen\\'s swinging around, making it annoying for her to move. But that\\'s where the \"puzzle\" part of the game comes from.\\n\\nIt\\'s really not too easy to describe the difficulty of a puzzle, but I\\'ll give it a try; on one level, the obvious path of \"push both sausages together\" ends up burning one of them. Many people get stuck here when they try and push one of the sausages out the way and fail. On another level, there is a moat around the two solitary grills in the centre, and you somehow need to get the sausage over the moat and onto the grill. Then there\\'s the tricksy Clover level, where you think you have the solution, but need to avoid getting trapped. On yet another level, you have to somehow juggle around three sausages on a small island, while making sure that none of them push each other off the island.\\n\\nMany times, when I\\'ve shown the game to my friends, they\\'ve all played a level for 15 minutes and simply given up, claiming that the level is impossible.\\n\\nWell, that\\'s just the first island. The second island unlocks once you\\'ve completed all the puzzles in the first island and not before, so if you\\'re not a completionist for puzzles, this game is probably not for you.\\n\\nIn the second island, there is a new game mechanic introduced; but unlike many other games, this game mechanic had always existed; it was just unapplicable in the first island (no spoilers as to what the mechanic is), and it\\'s at that point that you really gain an appreciation for just how well-designed this game is, if you hadn\\'t already gleaned it from the previous levels.\\n\\nBasically, what I\\'m saying is this; if you\\'re not good at puzzles, then your 23GBP would be better spent on The Witness, The Talos Principle, or a combination of cheaper puzzle games; you would probably just get frustrated at this game and refund it after getting stuck on a bunch of levels in the first world. If you\\'re good at puzzles, this should already be in your library, so go play it now.\\n\\nOh, and don\\'t worry about the infamous \"Tower\" level. It\\'s really not that large of a jump in difficulty.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Stephen\\'s Sausage Roll is a game that the developer doesn\\'t want normal people to buy, it seems. The description is literally, \"A simple 3d puzzle game.\", there is one video that shows you nothing about the game, and it\\'s priced at $32 CND.\\n\\nFortunately, I\\'m here to tell you to get off your ass and to buy this wonderful game. The graphics are alright, the music is OK, but the puzzles are sublime.\\n\\nIn each level, the goal is the same: cook all the sausages and exit the level by standing on the exit level sign in the right orientation. You cook sausages by pushing them over a grill. Like in sokoban games, you can\\'t pull the sausage (yet...), only push it. Another huge wrinkle is that sides of the sausage can only touch the grill once. If you touch a cooked side of a sausage to the grill, it will be burned and you fail the level. This little wrinkle will make you pull your hair out in some levels as you try and figure out how the hell you are going to maneuver the sausages around so they get cooked properly. A neat thing about the game is that if you fail, you can still continue playing the level, which might help you figure out how to play it.\\n\\nYou\\'ll have a section (part of an island) that has a number of puzzles for you to solve in any order, so if you get stuck, you can try another one (until you get to the last puzzle of the section). Once you complete a section, a new section will open up with more puzzles.\\n\\nYour little guy has tank controls, which you will find extremely useful, as turning to the left or right near a sausage will push it in different directions. A nice detail is that the all of the puzzles make up the island section. When you activate a puzzle, the rest of the island drops away into the sea, leaving you on a tiny puzzle island.\\n\\nEach section introduces new mechanics into the game. First you\\'ll just be pushing the sausages, but then you\\'ll be stacking them, skewering them (you would think this would make things easier, but no! You can\\'t turn when you have a skewered sausage!), walking on them...\\n\\nI would say that these levels are on the level of Snakebird, though I found many of them easier than Snakebird\\'s puzzles (maybe I\\'m better at sokoban games than I know?). These are the kind of puzzles that you walk away from frustrated, but come back to a few hours later with the solution. This is the game where there are so many ah-ha! moments that make you feel smart. You have no idea what to do at first, but eventually you get better and better. You might not see solutions at first, but you begin to see where you need to go to solve the puzzle, and then work backwards from there. It\\'s wonderful!\\n\\nIf you\\'re having trouble, there\\'s a community guide that has all the solutions, which is super helpful (though not as much when I was playing because it wasn\\'t complete!).\\n\\nIt might be expensive, but I took 36 hours to solve all the puzzles and it was worth every penny.',\n",

This game might be for you.\\n\\nThe geometry of the common marbled sausage is round. This property allows them to be rolled. Rolling a sausage is like playing the piano - hard to master, but very rewarding. Burning a piano is also frowned upon. Much like sausages.\\n\\nIf you lose a sausage at sea, it is lost.

       "  'review': \"Wow. \\nSame as with many people here, I'd initially heard about this game from Jonathan Blow. He'd been touting it as incredible for a while, but in a way that you couldn't quite tell if he was being serious or not. Add to that the fact that all the promotional material out there also makes you question if this is even a real game or not, and it being relatively expensive among its puzzle game peers, I was a bit weary.\\nWell, I've just finished playing through the whole thing, and I can tell you it's not a joke at all. In fact, [b]it's the best puzzle game I have played to date, hands down.[/b]\\n\\nI clocked in just slightly over 40 hours, which should give you an idea of how meaty this game is. The mechanics have so much complexity to them, and the game goes sooo deep in exploring every single little intricacy of them, it's ridiculous. And it does so with the utmost elegance. The amount of times I went to bed in awe of a puzzle I'd solved earlier is so large that I lost count.\\n\\nOne big thing that is so remarkable about this game is how contextual its mechanics are. In the majority of puzzle games out there you have common game interfaces used as a vehicles to explore unrelated abstract concepts. For example, in Braid you use basic Mario 2D platforming as a vehicle to explore time mechanics. But the time mechanics have no intrinsic logical connection to your little guy jumping around or picking up keys and whatnot. Which is fine, but it's so much more impressive when there is a logical connection.\\nIn Stephen's Sausage Roll, just about everything you do makes sense with common real world physics. The way you interact with the sausages and the environment all looks like it should logically work, with few exceptions.\\n\\nIf you're a puzzle game lover then this is a dream game.\\n\\nIf you're still unsold, check out the Giant Bomb quick look. It's pretty okay in giving you an idea what it is, and in not giving away spoilers. But know that that's just the tip of the iceberg, and there's so much stuff beyond that.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Ok, I am changing my review for [i]Stephen\\'s Sausage Roll[/i]. The original review can be found below, for transparency.\\n\\nI had originally purchased the game on launch day, played for just shy of 2 hours, and then refunded. My main problem with the game is that it is just too expensive. I still do feel this way, to a large extent. I mean its an indie puzzle game for christs sake. But its a damn good one, too.\\n\\nAfter I refunded, the game stayed in my mind. I checked regularly for sales, but nothing. Not even the summer 2016 sale, so I repurchased. I\\'m really not happy about the price, but I want to experience more of this game. Its good. The puzzles are very rewarding, and quite addictive. So far I don\\'t find it crazy difficult. Its got a nice balance that way.\\n\\nThe whole thing is just dripping with hand-crafted goodness. Thats the thing, really. The other thing is that if you look at the devs history, he has put out so many free games that maybe its ok to ask a lot for something you dumped many years of your life into. I don\\'t know. Its not charity at all - its great artwork and it has value. I mean you can say a lot of negative things about the price, but one thing you can\\'t say is that its a cash-grab. Its just not.\\n\\nAnyways, thanks everyone for reading and voting on the original review - I appreciate it. \\n\\n[b]My bit of advice is to get the game ONLY if you aren\\'t going to be bitter and jaded about losing thirty bucks. It is definately better than [i]The Witness[/i], and is one of the better puzzle games I\\'ve played this year, for whatever thats worth.[/b]\\n\\nPeace,\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n[i]Original review is everything below:[/i]\\nAlright, this game put me in a tricky spot for two reasons listed here:\\n[i]\\n1. After nearly two days since release (4/19/16), the store page and reviews really give me nothing other than 1] \"play this game its great - trust in increpare\", and 2] its worth $30.\\n\\n2. Being just within the two hour refund limit, I see nothing special. [/i]\\n\\nThe game is not terrible by a long-shot, in fact, its better than [i]The Witness[/i] as far as I\\'ve played both. The problem is that the price is just nuts - and it\\'s all on the promise that at some point I will be utterly mesmerized and hooked. Unfortunately that feeling is apparently beyond the refund limit for me. [b] I also firmly believe that games of this nature should probably give me more feels within two hours of playing.[/b]\\n\\n[b]No hate intended towards the game - but I wouldn\\'t recommend it to friends.[/b] With that being said, I don\\'t care to lose $30 on it when refunds are an option.\\n\\n---\\nOnto the review, proper:\\n\\n[i]Essentially, given very basic mechanics and rule set, you push sausages onto coals in order to cook them.[/i] Cook the same spot more than once and its burned, start over. Lose a sausage in the water, start over. Its tricky, but doable (at least first 15 or so sausages in early puzzles). Music is nothing special. Graphics are nice, but also, nothing to win an award or anything. \\n\\n[b]Pros:[/b]\\n+Controls are decent, and there is controller support.\\n+The puzzle mechanic is fine, and is certainly better than something you would find on a free flash site/NewGrounds/etc. (I say this because others have criticized that its in the same ballpark).\\n\\n[b]Meh:[/b]\\n[strike]=Idea and game mechanic are hardly new.[/strike] -I\\'ve changed my mind on this one\\n=Music is meh.\\n=Graphics are nice, if not a tad muddy.\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n-Very pricey. I appreciate that there is a lot of content, though.\\n-Not that addictive inwards of the first two hours of play for me.\\n\\n[b]I think this game would be a total thumb\\'s-up at like 50% of the price, or something.[/b] I thought this game was for me, and I was wrong. I also tried watching some LetsPlays before I purchased (at the risk of seeing spoilers), but as others have mentioned - the videos are not that informative because its the personal \\'aha\\' moments that get you coming back for more. I had none of those moments in the nearly two hours I played, and maybe another hour I read and watched LetsPlay videos.\\n\\nPeace,\\n\\n[i]Final edit: My play time rang in around eighty-some minutes. I found that as I was playing, towards the end, I was getting nervous of running over. I realise I had another solid half hour or so, but it was telling that I kept checking. I\\'ll stand by my judgement that I saw enough and made the call to refund before getting too close.[/i]',\n",

The way SSR hides new \"mechanics\" and has you figure them out will have you jumping out of your seat. Not only that, but each puzzle is there to teach you something new, so nothing gets repetitive. The game is also very very difficult.

       "  'review': 'Conceptually, I like Stephen\\'s Sausage Roll quite a bit. I think that the core gameplay mechanics are fun and interesting. The window dressing is fantastic- talking about rolling sausages and grilling them is worth a laugh by itself. The puzzles are simply sublimely designed and make use of every single bit of sausage-rolling complexity the game\\'s ruleset has to offer.\\n\\nAll of this is a shame because the game is so relentless in its difficulty that it ruins the whole experience. The puzzles start at a pretty good level of challenge- you might not understand all of the rules and strategies quite yet, but the scope of each discrete puzzle is small enough that you quickly figure out strategies and work toward a solution. You\\'ll eventually solve each of the puzzles in the first area and move onto the second, where the puzzles follow a similar formula and scope. All of this is fine until you reach The Great Tower- a Jenga-stacked tower of 8 sausages that represents the game\\'s first difficulty wall. Suddenly, you can no longer solve a puzzle through simple trial and error- you need to develop a plan of experimentation and strategy of attack to even begin to understand the scope of the puzzle.\\n\\nProvided you do in fact grill all of the sausages that compose The Great Tower, you will find that it isn\\'t simply a one-off \"boss fight\" of sorts- this is your new sausage grilling reality, as numerous puzzles in the next area follow its newfound scope. And that\\'s basically where I draw the line! I like puzzle games, but the level of difficulty here moves from simple brain-teasers and logic exercises to full-fledged logistic projects in their complexity. It also feels that as the game goes on it loses a bit of its focus- instead of each puzzle tightly focusing on a mechanic, much of the later puzzles require long strings of execution and moves. It no longer gives you that \"a-ha\" moment without lengthy experimentation. It\\'s simply too much work and effort for anybody but die-hards.\\n\\nUltimately- although I really do like the game\\'s ideas, I really don\\'t think that I could recommend it to anybody.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'m not finished with the game yet, or even close. Will update upon finishing it. Seems people are reporting an average of 35 to even 60 hour play times if that is of interest though. \\n\\nSo far it\\'s great, I absolutely love it. As many people have already said, the design is where it shines. The game never tells you what or how to do anything. You begin pushing and rolling sausages to fully cook them around and while it seems like a simple premise, you are constantly learning new things and playing the game in a much different way than you were before so it never feels repetitive. Often I get stuck and then realize, \"Oh wow I can do that?\" While being designed in a way where I naturally stumbled upon it by trying things that seemed possible. I have never thought, \"Oh how was I suppose to think of that?\" You can undo every move you make too so trying new things is encouraged. \\n\\nBut don\\'t be fooled by its funny name or silly premise. This is one of the hardest puzzle games out there. Think of something like Snakebird, another extremely hard game that looks all cute and innocent on the outside. So don\\'t complain when you get stuck within the first 10 minutes of the game. (Of course I also still have much left to do so it\\'s just going to get even more difficult. Though I look forward to it).  \\n\\nI can see why Jonathan Blow (Braid/The Witness) has cited this game as one of the greatest puzzle games of all time. Alexander Bruce (Antichamber) has given the game high praise as well. \\n\\nThe developer Increpare has created English Country Tune and a multitude of other small little games. Games I would also recommend checking out. He\\'s mostly known among devs and people who actually watch out for these lesser known titles. But I hope that changes, I hope more and more outlets begin to review/cover this game. \\n\\nStephen\\'s Sausage Roll deserves it.',\n",

It's amazing how much content there is with the simple game mechanics of the player, a fork and sausages.\\n\\nAs a side note, Steam thinks I only have 11 hours or played, which is because I played on linux and the game crashed a lot when I ran through steam.

       "  'review': 'A truly brilliant puzzle game. It takes the mechanics so much further than you would imagine, to the point there are genuinely \"Oh my god, did that just happen?\" moments. I got 30 hours of thoroughly enjoyable play out of this and can see myself playing it again at some point, so it was worth every penny. I have only positive points to make:\\n\\n- Very challenging puzzles right from the get-go.\\n- There *is* a learning curve - a very well crafted one - it just starts you off high. I\\'d say the level of difficulty is consistent throughout (given that you are also learning as you go).\\n- There are a lot of puzzles.\\n- The puzzles are meticulously designed such that they all have very interesting, completely different solutions and you can see how everything was arranged to make that solution and only that solution work.\\n- Pretty much every puzzle twists what you know about the mechanics (some will have you proclaiming \"This is impossible!\" before you *get* it).\\n- Every puzzle is super satisfying (to the point I\\'m shouting YESSSSS after each one).\\n- The graphics and audio are very well designed to not get in the way but also add a lot of character.\\n- Exploring the overworld is very enjoyable.\\n- You truly feel like you\\'ve improved as a puzzle solver by the end of it - there\\'s a very definite evolution in the way you think about the puzzles.\\n\\nThere was almost a point early in the game (maybe 2-3 hours in) where I could have stopped playing, simply because I couldn\\'t see where it was going. If you get past that hurdle, you\\'ll be glad you did.\\n\\nPerfect for puzzle fans. Couldn\\'t recommend it enough. Also recommend having a friend playing the game as well so you can talk about ideas and spur each other on. If you\\'re not sure, give it a try.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Stephen\\' Sauasage Roll is a possibly one of the best thought out puzzle games I\\'ve ever played. Unlike other Sokoban-like puzzle games, I feel like I could solve almost every puzzle I\\'ve played so far a second time without having too much trouble, and every puzzle has felt different. The puzzles in this game are about understanding what your options are, and they all feel much more open than other box pushing games. This means that you can\\'t brute force a solution, but it also means that you\\'re more open to experiment with the mechanics (which you\\'ll have to do a lot). After every puzzle I felt like I understood the game better for having solved it, even if only a little bit. I encourage anyone who likes puzzle games, or even those who just enjoy thinking, to try this game.\\n\\nEDIT: I just beat the game and I feel like I should add a few things, although I promise to keep it spoiler free. Firstly, The ending to the game is very poetic and almost entirely satisfying. To explain it any further would be a disservice to Stephen\\'s work, so you\\'ll just have to see it for yourself. I can say, however, that it was a perfect way to end the game.\\n\\nSecondly, the amount of thought and planning that must\\'ve gone into this game as a whole more than justifies the asking price, and if you count the time I spent think about the puzzles outside of playing the game it come out to about 2 days worth of \"play\" time. Although I may have gotten stumped a few times I always managed to find a solution with relative ease the next day, usually by considering an entirely different angle to approach the problem from. \\n\\nAlso, the slow reveal of new mechanics was paced perfectly. One in particular Was so unexpected and mind blowing that I had to undo my moves and watch it happen a second time just to comprehend what had happened. I you thought this game was simple then you are sorely mistaken.\\n\\nOverall, I have to say that this game is easily the best puzzle game I\\'ve ever played in my entire life. I\\'ve heard this called the Dark Souls of puzzle games, but I think it\\'d be more accurate to call it the Citizen Kane of puzzle games instead.\\n\\nStephen Lavelle, you are truly a master fo your craft!',\n",

I can get how many would be put off by the first few puzzles, but after that initial hurdle (maybe solving some of the 1 sausage puzzles first) you start to gain some confidence and then are on your way to being a sausage grilling champ.\\n\\nAll the above plus the super charming presentation, and this is already a game I'd recommend to anyone who enjoys puzzles or brain teasers.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Stephen\\'s Sausage Roll is the latest puzzler from Stephen Lavelle (English Country Tune). It\\'s a\"block moving\" game and a premium-priced indie. It\\'s also flat-out amazing.\\n\\nIn SSR, you guide the player around an over-world with nodes representing discreet puzzles. When you land on one, the world drops away into a smaller puzzle area. There you\\'re tasked with sliding and rolling raw sausages around the board in an attempt to grill both sides evenly via the strategically placed hot grill tiles embedded in the ground. Roll a cooked side of the sausage over the grill again and it\\'s burned...game over. Roll it off the level and it\\'s game over. The puzzles are ingenious. The puzzles are challenging. The puzzles are addictive.\\n\\nSSR sports a raw, minimalist asthetic with vibrant, morphing colors and an abstract soundtrack. It looks rough in stills, but is absolutely charming in motion. Controlling your character is strange, as it doesn\\'t adhere to traditional tank controls as you might imagine. Instead movement is absolutely relative to the direction your pointing in. There\\'s a learning curve, but it comes together and makes sense when you start to understand the finesse needed to \"thread the needle\" around sausages and environmental obstacles.\\n\\nAs mentioned, the game is challenging as hell. Even from the start. One nice related feature is the ability to take back moves, one at a time with the Z key. Even after a level fail (rolling sausages into the water / burning sausages) you can execute this option, alleviating frustration when you\\'re stringing together moves to set up a level clear.\\n\\nI think SSR looks incredible. It absolutely nails the low-fi aesthetic. Nails it to the wall.  All you have to do is look at the Game Over screen to recognize this is all intentional.  Just look at that font! If someone didn\\'t legitimately have the talent to pull off successful visual design, there\\'s no way they\\'d out themselves by choosing that font style. It takes confidence and deliberate intent to visually create something on the level of Stephen\\'s Sausage Roll.\\n\\nReviews are saying there\\'s a TON of content on offer here. 30+ hours of evolving mechanics that keep the game fresh with new ideas even late game. Still, a $30 asking price for a game that looks like an itch.io project might be a bridge to far for many. Totally understandable. I opted in after reading some rave reviews coupled with the praise heaped on it from the puzzler dev community itself. Jonathan Blow (Braid / The Witness) described SSR as, \"one of the best puzzle games ever made, or one of the best video games ever made”\\n\\nSo I held my breath and dropped $30 on the game. I\\'m REALLY glad I did as it\\'s pressing all the right buttons for me. I went to bed thinking about game tactics and solutions. I woke up and got ready for my day thinking about tactics and solutions. And here I sit at work, wishing I were at home executing tactics and solutions.\\n\\nKind of funny how the best and the brightest of the year can wind up being the games you never knew you wanted. Much like Stardew Valley, I didn\\'t know about Stephen\\'s Sausage Roll until days before release. Yet I can quite comfortably see both placing on my end of year Top 10.\\n',\n",

       "  'review': \"I've finally grilled all the sausages. This is the best puzzle game. Every individual puzzle is just so damn clever, no two puzzles are alike, and there are SO many puzzles. If you enjoy puzzles, you will like this game.\\n\\nThe difficulty comes because no two puzzles are solved in the same way. The game's mechanics are the same from the start until the end, involving rolling sausages and walking around, but each puzzle puts you in a scenario where you have to use the same old mechanics in a novel way.\\n\\nUsually, this is difficult because you didn't understand certain consequences of how the mechanics work. But once you flail around for a while and solve a puzzle, the consequences were clearly logical: how could you not have thought of that? Argh, it was right there.\\n\\nThis makes the puzzles feel straightforward and more importantly fair, even though solving them may be a struggle. There is no busywork of pushing around boring things that don't matter to the main idea of the puzzle. When you get an idea for how to solve a puzzle, it's quick to see whether it works. When you get the right idea, you KNOW it works, because the puzzles don't have unrelated filler and they're easy to think about. So the problem just becomes having the right idea, which is a LOT of fun if you like puzzles.\\n\\nI don't think most people are going to complete the first area in the 2-hour refund time. I certainly didn't. That's a shame, because although the first area's puzzles are good for what they are, and are necessary to teach how the game works, they are probably the weakest part of the game. As you learn things about how the game works, the puzzles keep getting better and better until the end. It's an extremely impressive body of work.\\n\\nThere is also an engaging story, which was pretty surprising! It starts off extremely vague, but later in the game there's more story text between every one or two puzzles. Getting more of the story was a good motivation for solving some more puzzles.\\n\\nI really liked this game. And I'm definitely going to get some replay value out of it: I've already forgotten how most of the puzzles work!\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'m only about 40 sausages in, and this is already one of the most beautifully designed puzzle games I\\'ve ever played. I\\'ve noticed that a lot of commenters in the discussion feel like the positive reviews aren\\'t helpful, so instead of just getting all poetic about how awesome this game is, I\\'m going to try to be a little more concrete.\\n\\n1. This is a game for puzzle-game lovers. If you\\'re not into puzzle games, it isn\\'t going to thrill you. If you love puzzle games, but aren\\'t super into Sokoban-style games (like me), you are going to end up surprised by how much you love this. It\\'s basically Sokoban-like, but it takes the concept to a whole new level. I will try to be specific:\\n\\na) The sausage fork is both a tool and a handicap. As a tool, it allows you to push sausages in directions other than straight ahead (and do other things I won\\'t spoil). As a handicap, it constrains how you can situate yourself to push sausages.\\n\\nb) A sausage itself has two sides, and each push (with exceptions I won\\'t spoil) rolls it to the other side. This creates extra constraints when trying to grill each side only once. Sausages are also two tiles long, which creates extra constraints based on both orientation (vertical or horizontal) and grilling all four parts of the sausage.\\n\\nThese additions to the basic Sokoban-like mechanic result in a very large design space for difficult and epiphany-producing puzzles. Great puzzle games are about two things: constraints and topography. SSR hits a sweet-spot (or a spicy-spot if that\\'s your preferred sauage type) for a simple system of rules that produces a wealth of complexity.\\n\\nBut a wealth of complexity doesn\\'t automatically result in a great puzzle game. There also needs to be a great designer who mines that huge space of possibilities for the most devilish ideas and unintuitive twists. And this is what\\'s getting SSR so much critical praise. The levels are designed for maximum epiphany and minimum repetition of tricks. It\\'s a subtle kind of novelty, but every puzzle gives you something new.\\n\\n2. Can you discover how awesome SSR is within the refund period? Possibly. If you do two or three puzzles on the second island and your mind isn\\'t blown, though, it might just not be your thing. My particular mind was blown pretty early on. I found myself skipping puzzles and then solving them on a background thread as I was driving somewhere. That\\'s a pretty sublime feeling. Another sublime feeling is the sense that a puzzle is simply impossible, follwed by the discovery of a solution. This has happened to me constantly while playing SSR.\\n\\n3. The art style. I see people calling it \"simplistic\" and \"primitive\", which I think misunderstands it a little, because it implies that it\\'s unintentional or the result of inability. My sense is that the game looks the way the person who made it wants it to look. Part of the fun of the game is the campiness. If it were logs or plain cylinders instead of sausages, it wouldn\\'t be as endearing. And if the world and its sausages were rendered more realistically, I don\\'t even know what I\\'d think. It would probably be creepy. Again, though -- if the art style isn\\'t to your taste, then it will probably detract from the enjoyment for you.\\n\\n4. The price. I write games myself, so I\\'m probably biased, but I really like seeing indie games being priced higher than a crappy Domino\\'s pizza. I don\\'t know how many hours it will take me to finish the game, but I\\'ve seen people with over 30 hours in it who aren\\'t done yet. A buck an hour doesn\\'t seem like a lot to me, when I often spend twice that rate for a 45-minute TV show. I can understand not wanting to spend that much, but I don\\'t really get why people feel offended by it. It\\'s a market. The seller sets a price and people either buy it or don\\'t. It ends up being either a good decision or a bad one, and that\\'s pretty much that.\\n\\nSummary: I love puzzle games as much or more than I love sausages, and this is likely to be one of my favorite games of all times. We have entered the Golden Age of puzzle games, friends, so pony up the 22 quid and bask in its greasy, sizzling glory.',\n",

That's not due to the difficulty, but the music, visuals and lack of instructions (other than what the keys do) make it a bit hard to digest in some scenarios.\\n\\nDespite all this, there's been a torrent of sausage jokes around here, and I honestly can't remeber when's the last time I thought so hard about wieners...\\n\\n\",\n",

Really keeps you thinking!\\n\\nDespite the positive review, to be totally honest, I returned it after half an hour.  I'm quite interested in where it's going, but I'm not sure this deep level of difficulty is going to keep me engaged for long enough to justify $30.  Despite that, I'll definitely be picking it up again when it's cheaper- I just don't know how long I'll be gripped.\\n\\nPeople who like mentally challenging puzzle games, definitely check this out!  If you liked Snakebird or The Witness, it's a good purchase.  Otherwise, maybe hold off for a bit,  but still keep an eye on it.  It's an interesting enough experience that you'll probably want to get it at some point.\",\n",

I also didn\\'t yet finish the game, but played a few hours and got through the first set of puzzles.\\n\\nThis is a game that gives fairly little explanation, seems to intentionally avoid having a tutorial, and has some really clever puzzles. The puzzles start out very hard and get harder. When you first play, you probably won\\'t be able to solve a single one, and most of them will seem like there isn\\'t any possible way that they could be solved. But when you solve one, the pleasure of finally figuring it out will be so great that all the frustration will be worth it.\\n\\nI understand that there is a lot of trepidation due to the relatively high price. If someone is worried about that, just google \\'increpare\\'. The developer has created and released over 100 games for free, most short and experimental. If someone isn\\'t sure that they want to spend so much money on what is a leap of faith, they could play those first (or exclusively). I particularly recommend his free game \"Opera Omnia\".',\n",

       "  'review': 'It is very difficult to write about, Stephen \"Increpare\" Lavelle latest game: Stephen\\'s Sausage Roll. The first difficulty is that it is a puzzle game and, as such, its core virtues are in its mechanics and in its level design. The second difficulty is that discovering the mechanics is an integral part of the game so keeping things spoiler free without being vague is tough. Let\\'s try though.\\n\\n\\nThe incredible elegance of Stephen\\'s Sausage Roll comes from the fact that from the very start of the game to its very end all the rules of the world are there, but the complexity and richness of the rule set are only unveiled little by little, because new puzzles offer the potential for new situations where new rules are discovered (and are often needed to solve the puzzle). To make an analogy, if you are able to walk on water but are in a desert, you can\\'t know you have this ability. So Increpare would make you start in the desert, then later would put water in a level that would at first feel impossible until you realize you can in fact walk on water.\\n\\nMy analogy is not very good, because the beauty of this game\\'s design is that, more often than not, it\\'s not the apparition of a new component that allows a new rule to be discovered, it\\'s using new configurations of known elements. Also the abilities and rules you discover do not come out of left field, they make sense and if they might be a little too surprising, levels are carefully designed (with funnels or bread crumbs) to guide you toward their discovery. Something that works with my analogy though is that an alarmingly high number of levels will at first make you believe they are impossible to solve. I can\\'t tell you the number of times I discovered a new level only to mutter (or shout...) \"What???? How???\"\\n\\nWhile I am slowly running out of superlatives, it is also important to note the game manages the feat to be both very long and very dense. Those familiar with Increpare\\'s other puzzle games, be it the number of free games on the puzzlescript platform he created or his previous commercial product, English Country Tune (also highly recommended), know his aversion for fluff such as mundane tutorial levels, so these sausages are pure meat from the get go. There is no such thing as a level that does not bring something new to the table in form of an original challenge, so solving any single puzzle is extremely satisfying. Reaching this point is the fruit of a strenuous work of distillation that lasted years with dozens and dozens of levels that got discarded and all the rest going through multiple iterations and fine tuning to be sure that, as often as possible, they provide challenge the whole way through their resolution.\\n\\nTo give a sense of the scope of the game, I played through the final build in about eighteen hours, while I knew just about all the mechanics and had played most of the levels in an earlier build a year or so ago, so I would expect people new to the game to easily go past the 30 hours mark. It is important to note because, at $29, the price can feel pretty steep for an indie puzzle game, but that\\'s probably less than $1 per hour of pure gameplay and level design meat. Another way to look at it is that it is without a doubt the cheapest masterclass in puzzle design money can buy!\\n\\nWith this package also comes a thin and strange narrative that works hand in hand with the structure of the game, and an aesthetic which at first seems a bit crude and rudimentary, but really grows on you with its surprising care to details such as weather effects, day/night cycles and a soundscape periodically haunted by some minimalist musical tracks. It should also be mentioned that the control of the character takes a little time getting used to, but pretty quick it becomes apparent as to why it is the way it is. Every move matters.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I was fortunate enough to become a tester for this gem of a game. Stephen's Sausage Roll is one of the most carefully designed games I've had the pleasure of playing. It's also one of the most challenging puzzle games I've ever played.\\n\\nYou begin shipwrecked on a mysterious island. Your only tool is a strange fork and all you can do is move forward, backward, and rotate. You're given very little information, but you'll soon find yourself in one of the game's devious puzzles. Your goal? To roll sausages over to the grill tiles placed on the floor and cook them. That's it. SSR forgoes complex mechanics seen in other puzzle games for simplicity and elegance. You may not see how you can use your limited moveset to accomplish what you want, but there is always a way.\\n\\nAesthetically, Stephen's Sausage Roll is a succulent treat. Colorful low-fi visuals, soothing accompaniment, a day and night cycle, and an overall tranquil atmosphere. There's also some cryptic story to be uncovered in notes you'll find throughout the island.\\n\\nNow, as I said before, this game is hard. The puzzle-solving is based on experimentation and your familiarity with the (sometimes hidden) mechanics. Luckily the game is very forgiving in this regard. You're given access to a variety of puzzles at the start of each area and you have unlimited undos available for when you mess up (and this will happen). SSR expects you to learn from its challenges and it's very adept at teaching you new things through the puzzle solutions you discover (sort of like The Witness).\\n\\nOverall, this game is really something special for puzzle game fans. I admit I haven't made it that far in the game, even with all my hours of play, but I'm excited to see what awaits. Sausage is tasty and so is this game.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"(Disclosure: I'm in the credits as a tester) One of the best games ever made. Unlike basically every other puzzle game, it asks you to solve a new deep problem on every single level. There's very little emphasis on forward planning, and puzzles are compact but impossible to brute-force. It starts as a soko-ban-like game, but quickly unfolds into something much more ambitious. It's incredibly tough but never in an unfair or arbitrary way, and by the end of the game (40-80 hours I would say) you feel an incredible sense of expertise. \\n\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Just played the first few levels, so take this with a huge grain of salt as I literally just started it. I also made a video to show off the gameplay, which you can see here: https://youtu.be/KbWNYiWCzn4\\n\\nThe controls take a lot to get used to and feel very cumbersome at first, which isnt a good sign for a puzzle game. However, the difficulty in controls were very well integrated into the (excellent) level design and game mechanics, creating some extremely devious challenges. If you want to sink your teeth into a puzzle game, this will give you a lot more meat than you can chew.\\n\\nWord of caution though, the base mechanic does revolve around \"pushing blocks\" (or sausages in this case) and its not too far off from other similar games like Sokoban. Stephen\\'s sausage roll is adding another level of complexity onto a very familiar subgrenre (block pushing puzzle games), making it very challenging, but it is also not really pushing for anything new. And the price point is sort of the sore thumb here in regards to that. From what I can see so far: \\n\\nIs it a good game? Yes. \\nDoes it deserve your money? Absolutely. \\nIs it worth 30$? That is entirely up to you, in regards of how much you value challenge in your puzzle games.\\n\\nI love challenging puzzle games and I am looking forward to biting into this eventually when I have more time for it, but I appreciate new ideas more than I do just challenges, and going back in time, based on what I played so far, I would not recommend myself to buy it at 30$.',\n",

It's eery, yet safe.\\n\\nThe gameplay and puzzles are fantastic and will have you pulling your hair out, consuming you when you can't play it, begging you to go back as soon as you can because you think you know the answer.\\n\\nSSR is like the Dark Souls of puzzle games. It doesn't explain anything to you, it doesn't hold your hand but let's you just go about your thing. Lastly, it gives you a good, old fashioned challenge, which until recently with games like Snakebird and The Witness, were pretty rare.\\n\\nI'm super impressed and highly recommend SSR.
