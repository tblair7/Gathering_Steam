       "  'review': \"I like the idea of having to work together and try to escape with not knowing right off the bat who it is within your group that is trying to sabotage and/or kill the group. My first insight is right now there really isn't that many people playing, feels like less than a hundred as you match quite often with the same people you've played with. Now assuming other players are already in a lobby and if your game just ended this could explain with the same people trying to get right back in they get grouped often. I feel the biggest thing right now that could use an addition is marketing and getting the game out there more. Another thing to note is when in-game you should have a good play-through, however sometimes when connecting the game will crash every hour or so when joining. Sometimes it's everybody that crashes and sometimes it will be just you.\\n\\nSuggestions:\\nMake it so you can turn using the mouse as well (could be an option) so wherever your mouse is aiming, that's where the player looks. This would also assist with picking up objects as you would have 360 degree turning instead of the 45 degree (w,s,a,d).\\n\\nLastly, keep in mind viewers, this game was just released today and I am sure these will be worked on in the near future. This game does have potential if they can get the marketing out there and fix a few things, maybe also make it easier to move with my suggestion above.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"This game is OODLES and OODLES of fun. You can play it with random strangers, or with a group of friends. I highly recommend playing it with people you know, or at least decently respect. With the game in full release, there are some unlikeable players making rounds, but it's nothing that you can't fix by kicking them out of your lobby.\\n\\nEverything about this game is beautiful. The art, is especially stunning, and the mechanics are reminiscent of GMOD's Trouble in Terrorist Town. \\n\\nThe simple gunplay make it a non-mechanical game that welcomes new players. (Meaning you don't have to be a CS:GO pro to plan your kills). Your go-to weapon instead, is your microphone, and your wits. An absolutely lovely game will take anywhere between 15-25 minutes, by which time you would have earned the trust of your prey, broken it, and thrown it down a hole where no one can find it ever again.\\n\\nThis game is in a buggy state. So far there are bugs that weren't fixed during the transition of this game from beta to early access. Some are as minor as weapon switching where you have to drop items, and pick them up again before you can use them; Some are more severe and prevent the game from ending. But overall, none of the bugs are deterrent to the experience. I would argue that the most fun I've had are during buggy rounds!\\n\\nProject Winter simply isn't a competitive game. Your measurement of fun is NOT explicitly tied to your win or loss.\\n\\nThis game is a LOT of fun because of the players. For people like me it makes for an awesome experience, and an especially nice icebreaker in terms of meeting new people, and bonding with people you already know. Should you decide to play this game solo, you'll be in for a real treat. But for an absolutely good time, I suggest playing with people you already know.\",\n",

It is a perfect game to play with friends, but I think playing with strangers from the community will make your first couple games more enjoyable. If you like games with a focus on cooperating with teammates, Project Winter is a must. The gameplay is relatively fast where the longest a game could last is 30 minutes, but most take around 20 minutes to complete. Completing the objects in game isn't as easy as you'd expect because while trying to repair them, you have to maintain your warmth and hunger. Also, two of the 8 people with you are traitors with the sole purpose of sabotaging and killing you. With the constant concern that someone can and will betray you at any point leaves for very entertaining conversations with your fellow survivors as you try and frame each other as traitors.\\n\\nWith over 70 hours in the game, being long conned by a traitor still gives me an  adrenaline rush.\\n\\nGameplay 9/10\\nCommunity 9/10\\nSounds 10/10\\nArt Style 10/10\\n\\nHighly Recommend.\",\n",

You work together to complete objectives with your teammates only to find out two of them have been trying to kill you all along.\\n\\nI recommend this game if you like co-op. If you don't want to talk to teammates, everyone will think you're suspicious and you won't make it very far. It's mostly about survival with a dash of social deception. It's difficult to actually get away with things as the traitor, especially if you are playing with friends who expect you to group up with them and do objectives. However, this makes it even more fun for everyone when the traitors do well.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Fantastic game! Played the open beta the first weekend of February with buddies and with randos. Generally the community was awesome. There were a couple bad eggs but like 95% worked together, were funny, and enjoyable to play with. The game itself feels super well designed outside of a few minor bugs, but that\\'s the point of open beta so no worries there. \\n\\nI was totally lost my first game but even after that very first one I had a general idea of how to play, and I learned something new every game (I think I played about 10-15 during beta).\\n\\nThe in game cosmetics are lots of fun to unlock, paced well, and currently come from playing and accomplishing in game goals, which I love. In every game you can accomplish tasks whether they\\'re personal to you or for the team as a whole and from these you get points at the end of every game. Even if you \"lose\" you gain points, so every game feels fun and losing doesn\\'t feel bad at all in this game, it really is just fun as hell to play.\\n\\nThere is a mechanic where you can choose to take a bonus objective or not in game, and it\\'s a gamble. If you accomplish it you get extra \"currency\" to buy chests with cosmetics, but if you fail that amount of points is subtracted from your final score. I found that my team would help me to accomplish mine and I was happy to help them with theirs as well. I loved that from the community. \\n\\nI imagine they might introduce micro transactions but I hope they keep all items unlockable from gameplay also. \\n\\nWonderful game to play with friends if you can get 7 others together for a game of 8, but just as good if you have one or two buddies and queue up together. MUST MUTE DISCORD IN GAME! My friends and I found the game to be much more enjoyable when played correctly, and being in an external voice chat kinda ruins the whole point. \\n\\nGameplay 9/10\\nCommunity 9/10\\nSounds 10/10\\nArt Style 10/10\\n\\nMy most important thought on the game:\\nI truly believe that communities of a game are not random, they come from the design. League of Legends and Rust are toxic as hell because they\\'re just inherently aggravating and losing feels so bad. The very design of this game (in my opinion) will result in a positive and enjoyable community. Because the game is fun to play, losing isn\\'t really that bad, and working together rewards you so much, I think the community will continue to be great even as the game grows. \\n\\nI\\'ll definitely be buying the early access of this game come Feb 7. I\\'d comfortably pay $20 and begrudgingly pay $30 because it\\'s so fun. \\n\\nThanks for reading!',\n",
